I prefer OMO (one man operation) or max 2-man team kind of workshops.  Through my own experience, only such workshops gave me personalised service which I really like.

"Depends on the model of the car. Jap cars tend to be quite simple and almost any decent workshop will be able to do the servicing. Some workshops are more familiar with certain brands which is not a bad thing. if more of the owners of the same brand visit them, they might be able to diagnose common issues faster/have parts available on-site.



Pre-purchase inspection for used cars, last time I asked around was around $100 and the bigger shops can do any model of car. 



One way to do choose is to keep your options open. If you try this workshop today but don't feel comfortable with service/pricing/quality, then next time try another one, until you find someone you trust to work on your car. 

If your car is reliable, you only need to go WS once every 6 months. I stay in the East, last time explored WS in the West to East and now Sin Ming. I don't mind the distance since it is not a daily/weekly/monthly affair.",19-01-22

2nd hand cars are bought over when people sell, then they just resell to other buyers. Hardly, the dealer will do anything to the car when it's under their care, unless they were test driving it and broke something or found something needs fixing.



For the STA inspection, you can request the dealer to send in for peace of mind, but that would require deposit from you as a form of agreement you will buy the car if the results come back satisfactory or else they would absorb your deposit. This will be to safeguard people from choosing 100 cars and request all of it to be evaluated then not wanting to buy any.



As for repairs, it would be wise to spare 5K in  your bank account for repairs that will happen after you collect the car. Generally, a bit of repairs is necessary and it might be goodwill of the dealer either to help you repair fully, or split the cost, or advise you to absorb it as part of your ownership cost.



For servicing just google, some of the bigger names, like Autosaver (franchise) will be able to do most cars, mercedes, BMW etc I'm not familiar with the 3rd party shops out there.



Don't fret too much on the inspection of the car, mileage will be tampered, things will spoil and will fail, and repairs will be needed. You can't run from it.",19-01-22

2008 mean likely 2nd renewal already.



5 year COE cannot be renewed further.

10 year COE can be renewed again (3rd time).



Take note, when you scrap the car, you are only getting back COE (remaining) and scrap metal value. There is no PARF value anymore, if you intend to renew for the 3rd cycle of COE, 5 years COE cannot be extended further.



Your road tax is now at 50% of the base value, ie: S642 x 1.5.



You also need to go inspection yearly for COE cars.







For Toyota and Honda, generally, the spare parts are a lot and easy to get, so don't have to be afraid. just make sure the engine is not 'eating' the oil , brakes work, serviced regularly. Once collected, might be good to service the car once at it's odo mileage for peace of mind.",19-01-22

My advice: Stick to paying AA $140 for inspection. Workshop unless you know the very person doing the inspection will be thorough, donâ€™t bother ... even reputable workshops have tao chiews who think of themselves as seen-one-seen-all and do a half-Â£@â‚¬#ed job of inspecting a car.

Some even less than 30 . But dun have proper equipment to lift the car . 

The one I go recently charge more than 50 for labor , but they lift the vehicle up and got to check the undercarriage .

"Wanted to change default coding for car functions at start up.

Eg, air-con default at internal circulation instead of auto.

I drive in city area, always kena smelly traffic exhaust.



AD say cannot change default as it is a safety feature.

Not sure got kid me or not. 



Found on conti car forum a coding specialist.

communicated with him via pm and found that he seems to know his stuff.

He was able to articulate well and did not seem like the typical mechanic.



Went to his workshop to do the codings.



Coincidentally on day I went, my dash board has battery discharge error in morning. So ask coding man to help find reason as well, thinking electrical faults are easy to find with computer diagnostics.



My mistake.



The mechanic ask if I want to do free 21 point car check. 

I politely declined as just had a full car check at AD.



Sitting in lounge, after awhile, coding man told me;

1) Battery discharge error due battery weak, need to change.

2) Brake pad worn out, need to change.



KNN, thot i said no need to do car check, why check brake pads?



Anyway I was shocked as I just changed brake pads with AD 1 week ago.

I requested for a photo of my car worn brake pads thinking either this mechanic play punk or AD never change pads but charged me for it.

Ended up the owner apologise and say the mechanic saw wrongly about the brake pads.



Paid for coding and battery change.



The discharge error was still there the next morning.

Brought back to AD and realised it was due to the car cam wiring that I installed afew days ago.

Simple rewiring solved the problem.



I was happy with the codings outcome. 

The workshop owner even threw in afew other codings free. (no cost to him as just plug in computer and change defualts, all done within minutes).



Paid for a new battery I didn't need.

Almost got scammed into changing brake pads.



I learnt that workshops invite you into their workshops with freebies / deals so that they have reasons to check your car and try to scam you into changing parts.



Some malicious ones may intentionally damage you car if you don't give them some form of business.



Finding a trustworthy workshop is a challenge.

Coincidentally on day I went, my dash board has battery discharge error in morning. So ask coding man to help find reason as well, thinking electrical faults are easy to find with computer diagnostics.



My mistake.



The mechanic ask if I want to do free 21 point car check. 

I politely declined as just had a full car check at AD.



Sitting in lounge, after awhile, coding man told me;

1) Battery discharge error due battery weak, need to change.

2) Brake pad worn out, need to change.



KNN, thot i said no need to do car check, why check brake pads?



Anyway I was shocked as I just changed brake pads with AD 1 week ago.

I requested for a photo of my car worn brake pads thinking either this mechanic play punk or AD never change pads but charged me for it.

Ended up the owner apologise and say the mechanic saw wrongly about the brake pads.



Paid for coding and battery change.



The discharge error was still there the next morning.

Brought back to AD and realised it was due to the car cam wiring that I installed afew days ago.

Simple rewiring solved the problem.



I was happy with the codings outcome. 

The workshop owner even threw in afew other codings free. (no cost to him as just plug in computer and change defualts, all done within minutes).



Paid for a new battery I didn't need.

Almost got scammed into changing brake pads.



I learnt that workshops invite you into their workshops with freebies / deals so that they have reasons to check your car and try to scam you into changing parts.



Some malicious ones may intentionally damage you car if you don't give them some form of business.



Finding a trustworthy workshop is a challenge.

To them, is a added value service offered to customers. You want to change or not, decision is yours.

As others mentioned, move your butt and walk around... chat with the mechanics that handle your ride. 

Yes, nice cozy air con customer lounge and free drinks and movie is tempting. lolz",24-08-20

			If u go outside wkshp, get off ur butt and walk around ur car to look see look see ask qns. So when wkshp owner charge u something, u know its BS or not. The mechs will tell u as it is, the wkshp owner will try cannon fairy u.

Yes it happens but rare. Those they employ are usually Malaysians who worked in garages back hm.

And ur wrong abt sing same song as boss.

That is bec the boss have not ""aligned"" story with mech. The qns u ask is on the spot to the mech. The boss will say one thing when u payin and u rebutt with what mech said, boss back peddle. Those who have done this would have encountered it b4.",25-08-20

u point out ur damages prior to work commencement. After finished u check ur car b4 u leave workshop. Any addition damages they have to resolve, there is no escaping that. But if its ur car internals that u cannot see and only find out later, bring back wksp talk to boss nicely and firmly to fix. Thats all u can do.

I think there is a standard battery test where it churns out some report that indicates the battery life. 

U can request to see this battery test report or consider getting a 2nd opinion at WS 

u trust so u don't get caught out one fine morning when ur car don't start due dead batt.

I've ever encountered this previously.

I open my passenger side window everyday.

When I took back the car after servicing, I realised the window not working.

Immediately I point it out to the workshop owner.

The owner replied it can't be damaged by them as the servicing does not require them to dismantle the door panel which may damage the window unit.

They quoted me $1600 for replacement of window unit.

Did not repair window.



That servicing session, the servicing advisor say need to change battery.

I replied in whatsapp to change to cheapest available as car due for scrape in about a yr.

At payment, realised they billed me for a more expensive batt.

The svc advisor realised his mistake and ask mechanic to replace again.



Not sure if this ""extra in-out work for the mechanic"" lead to the damaged window.

Yes, I'm referring to power window unit in a BMW.



precisely the point made by workshop damage was not done by them.

sounds like suay and not workshop problem. 

Changing battery will not likely lead to window motor failure. Got fuse protection. 

You cannot blame WS for some things. Some things are just waiting to fail. When it fails, no one knows.

It depends on your luck loh..



Some workshops dont like you to be around the place where they work...

worse is when the mechanic in charge fo your car dont like it..

he go meddle with something .. u put something in .. u also wont know one hor..





Just this week, I went for car alignment and balancing for $50 .. promo... advertised in Carousell.. This K.H workshop.. .....



so the alignment guy did the roadforce thingy great..

but then he pass the car to 2 guys  ... for wheel balancing.



Those 2 ****ers.. .only did the front 2 wheels.. and they never take out my rear wheels to  balance.



I asked them... back wheels no need ah..  one of the guy say.. No need..



So I lan lan.. just drove off loh..





If u insist on them balancing the rear ... you can be sure they will leave a nut  loose or put extra/less weight on one of the tyres.





LOW SES folks are like that one.... 





So for me, I got free time.. I also go different workshops ... and change or service stuff..



but now i know probably a few workshops I can trust with the price and service. 



Usually.. these workshops are the small workshops with 2 or 3 car lifters type..

and the boss is usually under 40yrs old and very hands on with the other 2-3 crew members one.



No lounge.. but you can stand there or sit at stools lying around.. 



But.. don't bother them. .just look from distance... when they working.. u can see what they are doing.. but not so close it irritates them...





For pricing, you must be thick skin ... just ask 2 or 3 workshops and you will know who is priced too high.. can eliminate..







And for relationship wise.. actually purely transactional lah... it's like all the other businesses.. u think the salesman or mechanics want to engage you in conversations and become friends meh..  They are so busy and just want to focus on doing their stuff.. and talk to people they want to talk to.  they also know you tlak to them is .. because your car there.. and u want to get into their good shoes.



So usually.. I tell the boss the problem.. he diagnosed ..he suggest solution and price.. i say ok.. or not ok ... and then the workers do.   



This type is very straightforward.. and if u go once or twice, the boss will know ur pattern and wont go beat around the bush with you one.   He not sure 100% will solve, he will tell you.. u can try this at this price.. but no guarantee..   >.. then you can do a bit of research before you go...



 you can also whatsapp him, no need to call him.  Just tell him what parts you want to charge, OE parts, or what brand u want, then ask him how much ..  He will just give you the price nad labour.. and you decide ok or not..  This is how i compare price or know which workshop to go to. But I not lookoing for the cheapest..   I only giving the workshops I know who are doing proper jobs and the markup is reasonable.





when i see a workshop with only workers and boss not around type or boss not hands on already. My experience tells me.. this type cannot go one.

Those wkshp don't prefer owner to be around, i dd encountered before and still insist and they also LL. 

Last week send my ride for brake change, first time uses this wkshp, OMO workshop. Boss (40+yo) do all the work by himself. Chatted while he changes the parts. I become his ""assistant"" from time to time, but i don't mind. 

This is kind of workshop i preferred. Can see how detail he works. 

3 cars subsequently came waiting behind and he told me, can wait then wait lor. Work on cars, cannot rush.

"Car Service at Yew Tee Industrial Estates



Anybody serviced your car at the workshop at Yew Tee Industrial Estates before? Care to share your experiences? Thank you.",
"Good evening all,



Posting here as there's very limited information on motorbikes..



I am both a driver and a rider.



I got into an accident this year where a car hit me when he was exiting a carpark when I was riding.



Iâ€™ve received a letter from TP stating that the driver has committed an offence of Careless driving causing hurt and action has been taken by the TP against the driver.



Iâ€™ve engaged a law firm to initiate the claims. My understanding is that on usual basis if you choose to go with your law firmâ€™s workshop, youâ€™ll not need to pay anything upfront for the repair of the bike as the law firm will settle everything for you.



As for myself, Iâ€™ve chosen to go to my trusted regular workshop to conduct the repairs and the law firm previously told me that in this case Iâ€™ll have to pay the upfront repair costs and I was fine with it, as I trust my workshop. I was estimating the bill to be in the range of $2 to $3K maximum. For whole bike respray, alignment and some accessories (brake levers, handle bar grips etc).



Initially when I send the bike in for repairs, I have asked several times regarding the estimated repair costs that I will have to pay but did not get an answer. 4 months down the road, the repair is finally done after chasing the workshop numerous times and the bill came up to around $7K.



I am totally shocked as I did not expect the bill to be this high. My repairs were mainly respray, alignment and some of the accessories (brake levers, handle bar grips). Nothing was done to the engine as it wasnâ€™t affected. The workshop did not inform me about the the estimated costs before commencing on the work, although Iâ€™ve chased them a few times. If they had told me the costs of $7.1K before starting the work, I will have never given permission for them to go ahead as I am not able to fork out upfront. And honestly, for the few work that is done, $7.1K is extraordinary high. The workshop claims that this is the amount that is given by the independent surveyor, whom was contacted by the workshop.



Right now, the workshop wants me to pay for the $7.1K before they can release the bike, the repair invoice and the independent surveyorâ€™s report to me. My law firm requires the repair invoice and the independent surveyorâ€™s report before they can raise the claims against the third party insurer.



On a check with my law firm, they said that it is highly unlikely that I will be able to claim this $7.1K back in full, as the costs are way too high and that the third party surveyor may give a much lower repair cost. So if that happens, the liability of 80% may work out to be around $3K to $3.5K. Law firm also recommended me to pay the full sum as previously I chose this workshop and thereâ€™s nothing much that they can do.



Will you guys be able to advise on what I should do? I am not able to come out with a bill of $7.1K. I need the invoice and surveyorâ€™s report for my law firm to initiate the claims as I have injury and medical claims as well. However, without paying the repair costs of $7.1K, the whole case may come to a stop and Iâ€™ll not get my compensation for medical and loss of income due to the accident.



Please kindly give me some advices! Extremely helpless on this case. Thank you very much!",02-09-20
"My suggestion.

Talk to workshop. 

Since they want 7.1k, you basically LL squeeze balls.

Just tell them your predicament.

Negotiate a sum upfront that you can pay, and the rest via instalment.

They bankrupt u also cant get money, so they may be open to it.

But something i dont uderstand why didnt you go through your insurer to claim?

I am both a driver and a rider.



I got into an accident this year where a car hit me when he was exiting a carpark when I was riding.



I&#146;ve received a letter from TP stating that the driver has committed an offence of Careless driving causing hurt and action has been taken by the TP against the driver.



I&#146;ve engaged a law firm to initiate the claims. My understanding is that on usual basis if you choose to go with your law firm&#146;s workshop, you&#146;ll not need to pay anything upfront for the repair of the bike as the law firm will settle everything for you.



As for myself, I&#146;ve chosen to go to my trusted regular workshop to conduct the repairs and the law firm previously told me that in this case I&#146;ll have to pay the upfront repair costs and I was fine with it, as I trust my workshop. I was estimating the bill to be in the range of $2 to $3K maximum. For whole bike respray, alignment and some accessories (brake levers, handle bar grips etc).



Initially when I send the bike in for repairs, I have asked several times regarding the estimated repair costs that I will have to pay but did not get an answer. 4 months down the road, the repair is finally done after chasing the workshop numerous times and the bill came up to around $7K.



I am totally shocked as I did not expect the bill to be this high. My repairs were mainly respray, alignment and some of the accessories (brake levers, handle bar grips). Nothing was done to the engine as it wasn&#146;t affected. The workshop did not inform me about the the estimated costs before commencing on the work, although I&#146;ve chased them a few times. If they had told me the costs of $7.1K before starting the work, I will have never given permission for them to go ahead as I am not able to fork out upfront. And honestly, for the few work that is done, $7.1K is extraordinary high. The workshop claims that this is the amount that is given by the independent surveyor, whom was contacted by the workshop.



Right now, the workshop wants me to pay for the $7.1K before they can release the bike, the repair invoice and the independent surveyor&#146;s report to me. My law firm requires the repair invoice and the independent surveyor&#146;s report before they can raise the claims against the third party insurer.



On a check with my law firm, they said that it is highly unlikely that I will be able to claim this $7.1K back in full, as the costs are way too high and that the third party surveyor may give a much lower repair cost. So if that happens, the liability of 80% may work out to be around $3K to $3.5K. Law firm also recommended me to pay the full sum as previously I chose this workshop and there&#146;s nothing much that they can do.



Will you guys be able to advise on what I should do? I am not able to come out with a bill of $7.1K. I need the invoice and surveyor&#146;s report for my law firm to initiate the claims as I have injury and medical claims as well. However, without paying the repair costs of $7.1K, the whole case may come to a stop and I&#146;ll not get my compensation for medical and loss of income due to the accident.



Please kindly give me some advices! Extremely helpless on this case. Thank you very much!

Looks like u trusted the wrong shop....can PM me the shop name?



U have proof that u asked for quotation a few times but was ignored?



Most likely have to talk to shop and reach an agreement....since u regular..might be able to talk to the boss unless things soured already.",02-09-20
"Alamak, first time i hear trusted/own/outside workshop chop more than the authorized workshop.

Looks like you trusted the wrong w/s liao.. please SIC the name so we can all avoid.



From my layman's view, there's no case since you chose to go non-authorized w/s, the most you can claim is what the insurance co deem as fair.

They can say ""oh if you go our authorized workshop xxxx it will only be $3k, so too bad here you go.""



Like the posts above say, since it's your trusted workshop, try to nego with them ba.

If you have proof they proceed without your confirmation, can try CASE or what.



All the best!",02-09-20

			My suggestion.

Talk to workshop. 

Since they want 7.1k, you basically LL squeeze balls.

Just tell them your predicament.

Negotiate a sum upfront that you can pay, and the rest via instalment.

They bankrupt u also cant get money, so they may be open to it.

But something i dont uderstand why didnt you go through your insurer to claim?

mel1888 I am trying to speak to them now but it seems like they are only willing to give a 20% off  For bike insurance I only bought 3rd party coverage as it is usually the norm. So I can only claim 3rd party.. For cars usually we get comprehensive, either any workshops or authorised workshops.",02-09-20
"This is weird. You should liaise with your insurer to settle the problem. Why find lawyer?



Anyway, what the workshop did was not the correct procedure.



Surveyor should come and survey the damage and approve the repair and repair costs. The claim 3rd party insurance since he was wrong. Sometimes they will claim OD first, then claim the 3rd party.",02-09-20
"Xcert yes since day 1 I asked them about the estimated costs. they went ahead with the repairs without asking me for confirmation.



When I towed my bike out of TP compound and sent to IDAC for reporting, the workshop made me sign 3 forms? It was a very rush signing as it was during the circuit breaker period. I roughly read through the forms and it was mainly authorisation to repair and payment to be made before collecting bike? There wasn't any costs stated on the forms at that point as independent surveyor has not come in yet. Even after repeated requests for the signed documents until a few days back, they have not sent me what I have signed.. :/",02-09-20

This should not be the case here since TS is claiming 3rd party insurance.



Only claim own insurance then the workshop (authorised or not) matters.",02-09-20

This is damn dodgy practice.



Accidents repair involving claims have to be surveyed by independent surveyor first to ensure repairs and cost are within guidelines.



This workshop obviously made you sign an agreement that you will pay upfront first. You signed so you have to pay first. No choice.



Take it as a lesson learnt.",02-09-20
"Ashton I know  like what most of the forums say, I trust the workshops mechanics but prob not the boss. No encounter with the boss previously when I send the bike in for servicing. However I did not know that he will resort to such unethical practice.. As mentioned in the previous reply to other kind member who replied, I signed 3 forms previously to authorise workshop to repair.. But even after the surveyor went down to give their recommended costs, they didn't check with me if I was okay with the repair costs before commencing work.. Not sure if it's a common practice..  and to be honest, the respray of a bike, alignment work and some accessories parts will have never amount to $7.1K. it seems like my repair of this bike is more expensive than a car for the same amount of job done..",02-09-20

My bike insurance coverage is 3rd party only, and I had to engage the law firm to file for injury claims, as I was sent to the hospital after the accident and has a mc period of more than 3 days.



Yes the independent surveyor that the workshop called in recommended the repair costs, that's why when I ask the workshop about the ridiculous repair costs, their reply is always ""this is surveyor's recommended, so we follow.""



Once we start the claim against the 3rd party insurer (NTUC), the quotation from their own panel of surveyor that has assessed the damages will be final. So if they say repair costs is only $3k, I will only be reimbursed 3k from the 7.1k I will be paying..



Independent surveyor =Quote as high as possible

3rd party insurer surveyor = Quote as low as possible",02-09-20

Yes.. And they took 3 months to repair my bike and they are still charging me 7.1k  Since May they have resprayed my bike already but over that period I kept chasing if I could collect my bike, the replies were super slow (sometimes 1 week late reply).

in IDAC reporting, I selected to claim 3rd party insurance.



For motorbikes, most riders go for 3rd party insurance only. only a handful will go for comprehensive.



If I am not wrong, if I am under only 3rd party insurance, in the event of an accident, I am not able to touch my own insurance right?",03-09-20
"For bike and car, always go to your insurance and proceed to the authorised workshop. They will take statement and process the claim for you.

3rd party insurance is like standby people to claim you. You cannot claim your own insurance. You can only claim other people. If your own mistake, you have to pay for your own repair and let other people claim you.",03-09-20

Existing color is also black~? My previous car was also black, it gets dirty easily and it gets super hot under the sun~ if only needs touch up then dun waste money to respray whole car~ after touch up, go for polishing~

			Why bother?



One of the reason I visit JB workshops is the approach of mechs towards troubleshooting.

If can be repaired or only replace damaged part my regular mech wouldn't recommend to change the whole assembly.



Of cos everyone's experience is different, I have visited so called ""honda specialists"", Korean car ""expert"", dedicated alfa romeo workshops, end day I think alot depends on luck, trial and error.



On a side note, I'm wondering if anyone has done car wrap in JB? Tempted by an ad by this ALVA Concept.

I think to be fair. Itâ€™s more of the current car paint condition that cause this issue than the workshop. Now a days all use paint code for standard colors mah.

Another thing is everybodyâ€™s tolerance level and expectations are different.",03-01-23

We decided on MB Autos because we read a couple of glowing testimonials for them. We met the boss and he test drove the car and he said to change only one thing and disagreed with the local workshop analysis. The workshop has ordered the part and the cost is RM220. I wanted to do servicing but they charge RM700+ and they are using Mitasu Japan oil so I declined. If anyone knows any workshop in JB that does servicing for continental cars that uses Shell or Mobil and also the pricing do let me know. The local workshop in SG is charging me $120 for the usual servicing.

Boss is very friendly, change my atf within 20mins and did some checks on my car (brake pad, engine oil, wiper fluid, etc.) and even clean my engine bay using air pressure gun. 

After everything, ask him how much and to my surprise he only charged me 15RM for the labour. One of the cheapest workshop I ever been to.

Buy locally and bring over to any car tire workshops to fix it. Freed is not common in JB, may have difficulty for the JB workshop to find the parts there, unless is a common parts used on civic or HRV in JB.

Suggest you buy the parts in SG and bring over and pay labour. Try to hide it well (not in your boot) in case you kana checked and need to pay tax at MY side.

went to the workshop coz it was pretty near southkey where I am statying for 1 night. 

gotta say service quite reasonable. told him of issue, he check the power connections and knocked the cooling fan before concluding that likely cooling fan dying already. was quoted 400+rm for replacement with Denso fan, told boss I will go back the next day and asked for opening hours, says he opens at 9am. 



from experience from other workshops in jb - esp the well-published one here, their timing are almost nv accurate, but I was there ard 9:20am and boss already working on something. Told me shldnt be later than 11am and got msg before 11am that car was ready.

think 1 of the things often missed here is the ""timing"" and this guy seem quite ""on-point"" on his estimation. considering most of us are not there just to do repairs/servicing, it does make this a plus point for me.

			Depends where which area you go. Labour cost is cheaper over there.

Let me give you an example:  Non- conti cars. For regular service, EO and filter.  Parts bring ownself, labour in SG oredi like $30-$50.

In JB, is RM30-RM50.



Cheapest regular servicing in SG: $33.30. EO change and OEM Filter and all the safety checks. This workshop still running. They use locally blended EO. Brand not popular.  For COE ride, drivers may consider to use.

For newer rides, drivers may not consider.



PS: The key point here is the EO chosen.  5W30, TRD Motul EO with OEM filter, RM300. (Quoted to me last week) Let me know if any SG workshop can offer this price. After conversion is less than SGD$100. (Rate was 3.15, last week)



Also, please don't say, aiyo, the time and jam and the toll fee. Please exclude all these factors.

Sheng Auto, Depends on what car, usually morning bring car, late afternoon can collect car liao. Of course, depending on parts availability. Thus, better call and ask for quotation and parts availability and booking.

For my case, cos driving myvi. So parts are readily available. Just need call make a booking. Else wait awhile if they run out of air con parts for my car. lolz

I did once changing cooling coil with them, that was at their old shop. Morning first car start at 1030am, remove dashboard. by 2pm, ready liao.

Thanks. Same issue as yours, traffic jam compressor doesn't kick in, no issue when car is moving. SG WS topped up gas but permanent solution will be to remove dashboard and fix the leak. Possibly cooling coil.

Compared to do it in SG, easily like SGD$50 and above. Thus, i usually do not ask for price down. Moreover, these days, all price up liao. 

As long is cheaper price than SG, i straight away let them do. Thats my logic.",23-09-22

Most of the time when owners wants to sell their rides, they will not bother to maintain it.



Take it as a no, have an oil change asap. That's the 1st thing I did when I've collected my ride recently. Why not go for one that provides XX-points check and let them tell you what parts needs to be changed (of course take note that you're not obliged to proceed if price is not right).

Take it as a no, have an oil change asap. That's the 1st thing I did when I've collected my ride recently. Why not go for one that provides XX-points check and let them tell you what parts needs to be changed (of course take note that you're not obliged to proceed if price is not right).



Tires are changed, did you check the year of manufacture?

DOM - date of manufacture. You look ar the tire wall for 4 digits (eg 2717 means week 27 of 2017). 



ATF - Automatic transmission fluid. 



Tires - Depends on tire wear (but recommended to change no later than 6 years anyway - and if not constantly parked under the sun)

ATF - There is no such nonsense as â€œlifetimeâ€ fluid. Change every 40k km at the very least.",10-09-20

You can actually gauge by looking at the dip stick. Low level, go. Gunk, go. I personally felt the engine was running rough, thus I wasted no time and went ahead.



Considering that oil change these days are pretty affordable at around $5x, I would still recommend to go for a peace of mind.",11-09-20

bm responded that coverage is 10 years only. mine unfortunately past 10 years. and even within 10 years is case by case basis and have to request and appeal. apparently this problem is common for Toyota and Lexus but not commonly reflected to Singapore public. so if new models still have this problem I will take that into consideration for new purchase.

But he say I should be able to continue driving but I need to top up coolant every 2 weeks. If I want to resolve the issue , have to replace recon import engine at around $2000.

So suggest u check your parts first before replacement. Maybe some are still good. Get a mechanic or go YouTube learn how to check



Now can only remember it's in Jalan Seroja area, dun have exact address. I replaced the rear shock system first then the front, each time about 100rm labor and takes less than half a day so total like 200rm plus. Go ask around workshops in Dedap, Seroja, Rosmerah areas and avoid those too near the custom. If they quote u around that price, can liao.

"If you had that expectation that workshops in the north follows what is practicing here in sg, then personally i suggest you visit sg workshop instead.



Over in the north, they would conduct the usual points checks (lubricant checks, air filter removed and air blow and under carriage.)  Then perform road test. They don't have a check list on clicp board while going around checking the ride. 

If you read couple of comments posted earlier, you would know how workshops in the north carry out their job. 

Got leak/ faulty then change. Anything related to safety, change. Can tahan till next servicing, then change on next servicing.

Actually the ATF filter for some car, at least for mine need to open up the transmission. So I gave up all together. Anyway it should be a closed system unlike the engine which has much contamination from the carbon.

			You wont doesnt mean everyone must follow you ma. The cost for upkeep an old car is high because of the need to troubleshoot when parts are not working. Over the long term it is far cheaper and less hassle to replace everything at one go. Imagine for every thing small that spoil you pay for labour of $100++ to bring down the car bottom. Shocks spoil change, spring spoil change bush spoil change shocks mounting spoil change...you will be paying how many times for labour to just change shocks related stuff? The road is full of penny wise pound foolish man like you. Here i am dishing out FOC advice and you think you know it all. *chortle*

I doubt anyone who renewed 5 years coe will spend such money. 10 years also a difficult decision to made too. Ppl who renewed coe want to save $$$ one if not why renew. 

COE toyota bnb car usually depreciate about $6.5k per year. Adding $8k which is $1.6k extra per year totally make no financial sense. 

Ppl will rather scrape it and take back the remaining coe and lost the parf which usually are less than $8k.

Changing whole section because one portion is spoilt so i can save labour later in long run dont work in SG with COE.

That time workshop checked have misfire. Replaced spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors. Last service need a gear box oil replacement.



I also washed my cat converter, very dirty I suspect engine running too lean.



Got slight jerking when idle sometime at traffic light. Vibration when stationary and D, but normal at N. Replaced engine mounting still the same.

 Very low. Major issue. At first glance i would say your gearbox is going. Misfire usually will change spark plugs first because it is cheapest($40 if you buy yourself), ignition coil is usually the issue though...good workshop will test each individual coil to see which one gone and change just that one. Lazy/greedy workshop change all one short without testing. Injectors actually rarely spoil, just need to clean using ultrasonic method. 



May i ask how do you wash your cat? Usually cat at this age is gone...if clearing carbon just need to run NSH. The other area u can clean for carbon is throttlebody.



Jerk at idle is gearbox issue. That i would say also is the cause for vibration at D. Engine mounting usually vibrates thru steering.



What is your rpm? If rpm is low or inconsistent..then it has nothing to do with mounting..but engine. Does your engine run rough? Touch the seats at stationary..do you feel slight vibration?",12-02-20

You say Cat is dirty. Should be running rich (not lean) if dirty. (Correct me if wrong anyone). Possible case of vacumm leak causing rich running? 



I think do the vacumm leak test first. Then check O2 sensors. Vacumm leak test (i.e smoke test) doesnâ€™t require change of parts and thus should be cheaper. 



If no vacumm leak, consider changing O2 sensors and MAF sensor (do it one at a time to isolate the issue).

			Some workshops are honest but workers are lazy. Some little things they will reuse old parts just because they look ok. For eg, and this is a very common practice...when replacing the drive shaft boot....there is a clip that secure the grease in the boot...a lot of workers will reuse the clip just because it is already in the shape to clip back..and throw away the clip that comes with it..because is requires a lot of effort to push the newly unseasoned clip into the boot. Now this is highly not advisable because the clip is such an important part of the boot...that if it became loose..grease will leak and dirt goes in. The idea of a tight clip is to secure boot firmly..hence difficult to secure. But most workers will skip this job. There are tons of things workers can do to  save their time.

 The upkeep cost can be high for coe cars not because of the parts required to be changed but sometimes the time needed to troublesome the issue. Sometimes an issue is visible because of a combination of multiple issues which takes a longer time to troubleshoot. Downtime can be frequent. We have a package that replace every physical components of the suspension system one shot + all engine seals/oil seal replaced. For comfort it will be same like new car.



Basically everyone's expectation is different..some just need the car to move..some expect high level of comfort...some expect totally zero funny noise/sound....depends on you really.

 Actually it depends. In theory any water can be put into coolant if you are not living in winter countries. Coolant has antifreeze properties which prevents it from being frozen. In tropics it doesnt matter. Though if one uses for long term there might be mineral deposits. For worst case scenario orange juice also can pour in. For me..i would say if pour water.. anything less than 50% should be safe.

 Usually those things spoil then change one. Coz those things do not affect comfort of car...and to be honest we wouldnt want to touch anything if nothing is wrong in the engine bay. The pipes have hardened and can easily break. It can lead to a hose of things needing to change. 



At most i would suggest to car owners is change radiator if leaks can be observed ..especially if he goes malaysia often. Leaks can still be used for a long time but most inconvenient is burst in the middle of nowhere or on a weekend.



In the ballpack of $8K including parts for normal sedan like Corolla. All original Toyota parts. 2 things I recommend only use Toyota parts.

 He never dissuade la. He just explain to them the price they paid for are already ketok price. The workshop that they recommended are famous ketok king.

 What is your ride? How low is low? You must had spent a fortune for such a simple symptom. Looks like you have one that is not easy to catch.



Have you changed fuel filter? Fuel pump? Check fuel line? Sensors there are many...but affect consumption..i am not sure if it will directly...any other symptoms? You can try oxygen sensor. There are 2. One below at the cat, another in engine bay. Other sensors are..Airflow sensor..camshaft sensor...control valve sensor..but i really doubt is sensors. Does your engine eat oil? Any workshop recommended u got top overhaul? Did u go for test to check pressure of each individual piston? Do u maintain your gearbox? Got change filter of atf?

 Ya...a couple of hundreds things may still work but not good...sometimes symptoms show up but it is a combination of many many issues..so difficult to catch...old cars can have really high cost of upkeep.

My drive only 5-6km per L. I saw online usually for my car should be 10-12km per L. I am like only half.. 300km plus with 53L petrol for 2L car.



That time workshop checked have misfire. Replaced spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors. Last service need a gear box oil replacement.



I also washed my cat converter, very dirty I suspect engine running too lean.



Got slight jerking when idle sometime at traffic light. Vibration when stationary and D, but normal at N. Replaced engine mounting still the same.

Try Auto Champion Star - have been using them for several years now - the boss is Ling and he's honest and reliable - prices very reasonable so much so i've never had to bargain. Highly Recommended. Great mechanics too!!



If you don't have the parts, he is able to get most parts from stockist in JB. I normally bring my own engine oil purchased from Giant [Shell Helix].



Whilst servicing, go get a Grab car and go to the mall to shop and eat.

@Infinite - if basic includes oil change, here's my previous post. Don't pay more than RM25 to drain & replace eo. Oil filter from stockist abt $5+ SGD.

where's that in woodlands? idm checking it out, but mine was ard geylang area lol 



anw for those who are interested here's a quick FR: 

- Went to Lten Pro, unfortunately closed on Sunday

- Went to Tung Chun Motorsport, unfortunately it's closed on Sun too; checked out 2 other workshops at each end of the street and they dont have the  alternator belt that I was looking for (plus the chinese uncle at one of the shop had a pretty poor attitude)

- Headed over to Giant Plentong area and finally hit the jackpot: Stumbled onto a small family-run workshop - the friendly boss quoted RM75 for the alternator belt change. EO servicing (with self brought EO) will be RM25. the icing on the cake was that the laobanniang even gave 2 mandarin oranges for CNY 

- Last stop was to change out one of my old tyre to a used Bridgestone, near Taman Johor Jaya area. The previous owner was using a Spectra tyre that looked totally hardened. Damage was RM80 for 15 inch.

			Please guys, do take note of these, Carclick garage is overrated and services is very very poor and lousy. If you guys are going for a normal servicing bring your own EO and filters itâ€™s definitely worth it. Other wise please do not go there, gentle reminder to all. I think really overrated when last week I went to check the knocking sound came from my rear undercarriage, yuan claimed that sound came from absorbers and replace the rear 2 after which the sound is even louder and he say was because the absorbers was new and the rubber was old. So I did not respond to it and after a few days went to another workshop to check and the sound actually came from exhaust pipes because it was loosen. And also thereâ€™s something very wrong with the alignment. At the r the alignment my steering wheel tend to tilt to the left side when going straight road. Do your own due diligence before heading there

			Hi guys



Need your help to recommend an experienced workshop that is specialized in coolant leak.

Iâ€™m driving a Suzuki SX4 ( just renew my Coe in March) and Iâ€™m having problems with leaking coolant. Below are the things that I have done previously :



1. Replace head gasket at rambo ( next to ksl)

2. Replace top gasket at lch( previously Ah yuan workshop)

3. Replace 3 radiator cap at different workshop

4. Replace water hose gasket ( car click)

5. Replace water hose clamp ( car click)

6. Replace radiator (car click)

7. Overhaul engine ( car click)



I have been to other workshops locally but none is able to solve my problem.

I donâ€™t mind paying a little more to have my problem diagnosed properly but Iâ€™m sick of trial and error methods.



Appreciate if the experts here can recommend me a proper workshop .

Thanks in advanced

happened to my old CS3 also, first radiator changed, then overheat again because pipe burst and changed, third time overheat like yours then workshop say is head gasket problem, so need to do engine top overhaul. Its like a chain reaction... i paid 1.2k for the engine top overhaul.

"Just to share, I went to try out a workshop in Permas Jaya called Tung Chun Motorsport. They do a lot of Hondas (some Google reviewer said they are Honda specialists), and I saw 2 old SG plate Civics visit them today.

I went to get my 4 engine mountings changed, plus change of EO and ATF. Only oil filter was from them. Boss gave me a package rate of MYR300, which seemed reasonable. I did ask another workshop nearby regarding change of engine mountings, and he quoted ""about MY250"". So I guess it's close enough.

Chat with another Singaporean there waiting for a friend, and he said he has been using them for the past 5-6 years, while his friend has been with them for around 11. Happy to have an alternative which seemed trustworthy.



Reached at around 10am, and done by 1215pm. I did notice the boss and his 2 workers checking something out undercarriage while preparing to change EO and ATF, but I couldn't really tell what it was. When paying, the boss then explained to me that one of the nuts was overtightened in the past, resulting in it not being able to tighten fully. Told me to notify him in advance next time and he'll get a replacement nut to resolve this issue, and assured me that it's ok for now. Therefore, I didn't have to probe what the issue was.

 This is very common. So many times i recommended my customer to change things that doesnt solve the issue(completely).



The dynamics of a car means symptoms that you see can be created by more than 1 reason. 



OR



When something is fixed, due to disturbance harmonically, something else gives way. Just one example. ATF change. Sometimes it works perfect but after ATF change...jerking starts..it is not spoil..but because the pressure inside is disturbed...something became loose..and some symptoms appear. It works the same way as our body...someone may be OK after smoking for 50 yrs..but once he quitted he became sick.....because his body had adjusted and worked harmoniously.





Another example is this...i am very reluctant to touch anything related to radiator...if i need to..i will always tell the car owner to prepare for a new radiator if the pipe broke..because it has undergone tremendous heat for a long period of time and has harden...it still works..but you better not touch it...it is very fragile...can break anytime.",06-12-19

 I would say...anything with regards to car leg(è½¦è„š) and involves more than $300...seek second opinion. Coz many parts give similar symptoms. Knocking sound can come from tie rod to cv joint to lower arm. And shocks....usually dont give out sound...it dont even spoil completely..it just deteriorate slowly..become softer and softer...bouncier and bouncier...those are signs...if u do not take care of it and change..if it finally broke...then you will keep hearing knocking sound in every second of the ride.",06-12-19

Yes because they really did a lousy job, when I brought to the second Mechanic he spend effort and time checking and realised the sound was caused by the exhaust pipe which I donâ€™t even have to change anything. The first workshop I brought to claimed that the shock absorbers was fine but second workshop I went was Carclick and told me shock absorbers no leaking but was slanted and insist the sound cause by the shock absorbers so I trusted him and change but I eventually the outcome is displeasing. And afterwards which I WhatsApp him to probe on these as well as the steering wheel problem after alignment that he had done but he chose to ignore completely. Iâ€™m ok with him giving black faces as long as he does a good job but no, he did a lousy job yet acting like heâ€™s professional that everyone canâ€™t do without him",06-12-19

And in addition, my bearing was spoilt and he claimed that had no issue at all but the sound was so obvious that itâ€™s spoilt and he refused to change as he deem that itâ€™s perfectly fine, proceeding to change shock absorbers which is refund so end up the third workshop I went also have to replace the bearings.

 Need or not is subjective. Some drive until spoil then change. Some drive until totally cannot move then change. Some can drive means ok. Some got noise also cannot.



For me as someone in the industry..i look at time the part has been in used. I will never let a part gone to worst state. Maintenance is crucial. Fix early and you save other things. Just for eg..servicing..is it necessary to service often? Keep to schedule? Use good oil? Etc..the answer is...your decisions to all those...determines the condition and lifespan of your engine. Keep it well..spend a bit more for better oil...it runs forever....cheapo...use lousy oil...8 yrs..here leak there leak..soon top overhaul needed..



For parts..all have lifespan....for eg.. fuel filter...every yr once...atf every 80k...shocks can last between 4 to 7 yrs...sparkplugs..40k...ignition coil..100k..problem is if u don fix...still can drive...it will just take its toll one day.....",06-12-19

I always change my parts earlier and did my servicing regularly.

 If it is very obvious then no need worry...many workshop will be happy to perform the change for u lol. The type of symptoms we most scared are customer tell us yet cannot demonstrate to us...intermittent symptoms.



Like i say..you sounded innocent. It is all part and parcel. Just like if you are sick...you go to 10 doctors..all will give you different opinion.



Or..if you invite 10 food expert to sit down for a 10 course meal...all will tell you different dish is nice..because their tastebud is different.



For car repair here..main thing is the culture. There is no culture of charging for diagnostic here so very few people are trained to fix it as cheaply as possible. For eg..many things actually..just the bushes(rubber) spoilt..but there is no culture here to just swap the bushes...bushes only $3...how to make? Also take into consideration..labour...say steering bushes..need to dismantle entire bottom to access...labour will be pricey....paying $200 labour for a $3..is really not economical in the long run..next time..tie rod end spoil how?...pay another $200 for tie rod end fix? In the long run labour cost will very quickly outrun the cost of....just replacing the entire steering rack..which can last for a long time.",06-12-19

			Thanks for your reply. As for the cylinder head, I just check it during my last service but no milky issue. As mention before, this issue has been ongoing for the past 1+ year. Also, when changing head gasket ,correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but  I believe the mechanic should have notice any crack or damage.in the cylinder head? 



As for the crank issue, I have a car camera but it doesnâ€™t operate when the car engine is off. Will try to get the voltage reader or get my mechanic to check the next time .



Appreciate your advise

yes, most mechs will visually inspect to check for cracks. for warped headers, its harder to visually inspect cos u need tools for it, ie a straight steel ruler, and gap gauges. i have only seen it done once (sanding the surface of the cylinder block ) but this was in msia, on an old bmw. i believe in sg, the mechs will not resurface it, and will ask you to replace the cylinder head. 



try this 2 things. when u start your engine,  wait for a minute or 2 and then check if there's whote smoke from the exhaust. 

next after driving and parking your car, open the hood and inspect your coolant level. if u notice a huge drop (ie reservior almost empty), take out your torch and start checking the engine area first. gotta try to spot where the coolant is leaking from.



cranking issue. someone correctly suggested fuel pump. a faulty/clogged fuel pump could sometimes lead to crank issues as well. 



good luck.",19-11-19

			yes, most mechs will visually inspect to check for cracks. for warped headers, its harder to visually inspect cos u need tools for it, ie a straight steel ruler, and gap gauges. i have only seen it done once (sanding the surface of the cylinder block ) but this was in msia, on an old bmw. i believe in sg, the mechs will not resurface it, and will ask you to replace the cylinder head. 



try this 2 things. when u start your engine,  wait for a minute or 2 and then check if there's whote smoke from the exhaust. 

next after driving and parking your car, open the hood and inspect your coolant level. if u notice a huge drop (ie reservior almost empty), take out your torch and start checking the engine area first. gotta try to spot where the coolant is leaking from.



cranking issue. someone correctly suggested fuel pump. a faulty/clogged fuel pump could sometimes lead to crank issues as well. 



good luck.

when after driving and check coolant, please please do not open the coolant tank cap and try to peak inside. the pressure will be very high and the hot coolant will fly out. 



anyway, just curious did your mech do a simple coolant pressure test to make sure no hose is leaking?",19-11-19

			What cap you replace? The overflow pressure cap? After driving for maybe 30minutes try open the bonnet see if there is any liquid around the overflow cap. May be just a simple overflow cap issue.

were u the one who replaced a lot parts for your cooling system already? radiator, pump, hoses, clamps, pump, cap, head gasket... what car is this again?



check your eo again to see if it turned murky in color. use a torchlight to check near the engine bay area. and area below engine. i really suspect its a warped cylinder head. replacing a new head gasket will not solve coolant leakage when the cylinder head is warped. i really cannot think of other areas causing the leak since pretty much the rest of the parts have already been replaced.



since starter and batt is new, i can only narrowed it down to either charging system not working properly, poor electrical connection (check your batt contacts for corrosion first) and/or electrical leakage. 



do you have a dashcam that continues filming when u car is parked? this could be causing the leakage. sometimes, a leakage at bulbs at the vanity mirror, foot n door area or glove compartment can cause the drainage.



are you able to see the voltage when you r driving? i used to have something that plugs into the lighter and shows the voltage. i am now using a bluetooth odb2 port connector, and i can view it on my phone. 

on a straight road, drive at a constant speed and glace at your operating voltage. if it's > 12-13V, your charging system should be fine. anyting below that is a clear indication that somewhere in the charging system is faulty. ie connecting loose, alternator about to fail...

Thanks for your reply. As for the cylinder head, I just check it during my last service but no milky issue. As mention before, this issue has been ongoing for the past 1+ year. Also, when changing head gasket ,correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but  I believe the mechanic should have notice any crack or damage.in the cylinder head? 



As for the crank issue, I have a car camera but it doesnâ€™t operate when the car engine is off. Will try to get the voltage reader or get my mechanic to check the next time .

Both is referring to how stickiness at different temperature. XW is stickiness for cold weather. XX is stickiness for hot weather.  Since we dont have winter, we can ignore XW. It is irrelevant to us.



You know the difference between 30 vs 40? Don't follow manual blindly la, your car condition is not forever brand new. Agent will forever ask you to follow because anything wrong in the long run to your car is of no interest to them. It is you and only your interest. 



Generally lower number means thinner. Higher means thicker. When car is old, due to wear and tear the pressure inside is different so thicker oil is better for maintaining the pressure.

2 school of thoughts even though most oil meets standard like api, etc.



one says it doesnt matter. eo is just eo, so long as u change it regularly.



another says its not good, cos different eo brands use different chem for their additives and may have a negative reaction when mixed.

Will be heading to arshi to replace 1 of my side skirt as I damage it quite badly. 



Quote five by the boss was 400RM With spray n install. 



I nego with the boss to go down his shop put deposit and take colour sample of my car. 



Then next trip go down just fix and install. 



This will save lots of time. 



I compare with BTS he quote me 380RM BASED On photo I send him 

He say no need replace just help me do up n spray back. 



I decided to try arashi instead.",06-11-19

"Thanks for the heads up. Always passby and tot typical ac shop. Din know they are into coating.



How's the pricing like?",06-11-19
"You are right. If you want to go Jb make sure you get JB price. Kenna chopped by JHK. Might as well save time and do in Singapore. 



Change oil. Max you pay is rm20. Oil chane is so easy even your maid can do (if you jack up the car). 



Wheel alignment plus balancing should be rm50. 



Just drive into a random shop and ask for prices. If cannot get these prices, drive off.

			Definitely can save alot if one just throw car to workshop type in singapore. But if one already buy this buy that ownself then the labour is already very small cost...



Plus..those workshop you guys mentioned....are actually double charge you guys...i saw a few of the prices mentioned...they already treated you sinkies like caishenye then you all kept promoting them lol. The rambo and another shop...famous for ketok sinkies...



There are cheap workshops..but unknown ones....just randomly walk into one those kind..for eg...aircon topup gas...rm20...wheel alignment..rm20...all wheels balancing ...rm20.....these shops you guys go are already charging you guys in the region of something like rm50.

			No need to quarrel la. Come on, all adults here.



It's a freedom of choice. If u like to service ur car in msia, just go and then share the good n reliable places. 



If u prefer to do it in sg, just do it by all means. nothing what mah. 



May be the mods can consider starting another thread on reliable ws in sg. After all, this thread is more for those who like or thinking of going to msia to do up their rides. Just saying.

 Not quarrel la. Freedom of speech ma. It is not much cheaper la for the price mentioned. I saw one post said went rambo for compressor change rm1800. Got cheap meh? Do in sg la. Buy your own compressor $300. Get workshop to fix plus refill gas $60. Malaysia cheaper? Really? Only if you know their market rate and not convert to sgd then say cheap.",02-11-19

true la, must do homework first and ask around. but its people's choice at the end of the day ma. but sometimes, owners are ignorant or not so well informed, so get cheated easily.  



not just car repairs/servicing, some people buy home applicance oso kena cheated, buy used car oso kena cheated, buy furniture oso kena, buy food oso can kena.  last year, my parents neighbor (70+ elderly) told me she went to the mall to buy topup card for her phone, end up spending > $300+ for casing, battery and screen protection. i called and told her daughter what happened, and we hatched a plan. the follwing day, we went back to the shop in the mall and settle the score.

"I think Singaporean drivers going to JB should know what is their market. If Malaysian gets something done at rm20. You should pay no more than rm20. 



But some people will pay rm50 (because they will think to themselves that in SG they need to pay $20sgd). So thereâ€™s some â€œsavingsâ€.

always good to share. thats what forums are for ma.



ever asked around (jb, muar, bp, melaka, kluang...) and was quoted between rm400-rm1k for oil change and filter (my car need 6.7 qtr oil). can never understand why its so expensive there. yes, there are shops that advertise rm98, rm128... for servicing, but the minute i tell them I want w30 EO, the price becomes rm500+. lololololol. 



hence i typically do it in sg, where i buy my own 5w30 and filter, go to my mech and pay 20-30$ for labor depending on which mech i go to. all in usually about 150$. tranny oil change for my rides is usually 80$.



then a bro here recommended acma a few years ago. they carry pretty good brands of w30 oil, and it was cheaper than buying my own oil, filter and paying for labor. lololol. they usually charge me more cos their package comes with 4l EO only. but its ok la, it's usually not > than 120$ all in. 



ok must qualify here - i dont work for acma ah, i just thought that their pricing and service is quite good, and all their mechs are sinkies. so the more i will support this type of business.",02-11-19

no la, i will stick to w30, based on the manufacturer recommendation. i ever wrote to toyota/lexus japan and sought clarification, ie > 100k - use w30 or w40. cos a few mechs recommended older engine better use w40 oil for better engine protection...



anyway, they emailed me with a lengthy reply, explaining quite a few things which made sense to me. in short, doesnt matter what mileage, just stick to the recommended spec in the manual, ie fully syn w20 or w30 if i really want to protect the engine. that's what i have been using till today for both v6 cars. no issues so far.",02-11-19

It is not W30 or W40.



The format is XXW XX



Both is referring to how stickiness at different temperature. XW is stickiness for cold weather. XX is stickiness for hot weather.  Since we dont have winter, we can ignore XW. It is irrelevant to us.



You know the difference between 30 vs 40? Don't follow manual blindly la, your car condition is not forever brand new. Agent will forever ask you to follow because anything wrong in the long run to your car is of no interest to them. It is you and only your interest. 



Generally lower number means thinner. Higher means thicker. When car is old, due to wear and tear the pressure inside is different so thicker oil is better for maintaining the pressure.",02-11-19

My opinion is to go for 2nd hand. Iâ€™d look out for the following 



1) make sure tyres are still kinda â€œfreshâ€ in terms of manufacturing date and also there are sufficient depth to last for 1 year. 

2) what is the kind of front tyres u r using. Try to find matching kind. For example if front tyres r sports tyres but back tyres r comfort tyres, it wonâ€™t gel well. 



Once you use different tyres, you will need to be aware of the limitations. Hence always follow the 2 second rule and avoid cornering hard especially on rainy days.",18-10-19

			Hi guys, noticed Hawk tayar seems to be the go to place for tyres for most people here.



Just wanted to seek your opinion on a suzuki swift with about 1year plus COE left, rear tyres require replacing. Not intending to renew COE.



Should I just change to a second hand 15"" tyre in SG or would the prices at Hawk tayar still be more worth it? And if Hawk tayar is the more cost effective option, whats the ball park price for a pair of 15"" tyres at Hawk tayar?



Thanks in advance for helping a noob here.

I could head for a safer side, go for new ones rather than 2nd hand. 15"" type would cost you not more than $300/4pcs. 

First you have to firm up the brand and budget.",18-10-19

I did mine last year for about rm800. Front, rear and trunk. Fully custom made. The sides of the mat are raised, makes it easier to maintain. The bottom has some anti slip material.



I believe it could be slightly cheaper for sedan. Google ottoman n check with them. Their factory is somewhere near bt indah area.



Only problem is the wait time. Roughly 2 to 3 weeks if I remember correctly.",19-10-19

			I visit this shop yesterday, after I messed up my central lock while trying to DIY an additional gadget on my alarm and I accidentally done a  wrong connection which haywire my remote lock and cant open my hood.  I suspected I blown some of my fuse that is related to my lock unlock doors. 



I know that KSL shops there like Ah Wee , is not recommended base on what I read from here and one time I tried to ask for some gadget installation and price skyrocket high thats why I know. But I read from here regarding RAMBO, so I just want to try as its the nearest from Woodlands.



And I find it workmanship, attitude and determination is good. It is recommended. I ask the name of the mechanic so next time I can ask him to install for me whatever I need to repair or install on my ride. The lady is the owner , but I dont her name. I talk to her also that i will post my experience in this website. Take note Im not related to this shop. I've visited previously, Carclick, Sheng Auto Accs, LCH Brothers based on the recommendation here. Its best to try different shops to know which one is worth to service and install on our rides.  At least we have different alternatives . Enjoy and Safe Drive Bros.

I just want to do a follow update regarding my experience in engaging the service of this shop RAMBO Car Aircond & Accessories. After I messed up my remote lock/unlock system, I've waited for my another online gadget that cost S$20 from Aliexpress to arrive and I come back last Saturday to install it at Rambo at JB , I need to wait for around 45mins to install my newly bought gadget i.e. keyless system. Then the technician ask me what to install so I showed it to them with 2 relays that need to be installed also to convert from positive to negative using the relay. In short it was installed after 30 minutes. So I tested it and it works as what I expected basically. I didn't asked how much it will cost me to install it. Then I asked how much is the charge? I was surprised when the boss tell me RM50, I asked for my wife RM100 just in case before she go for shopping at KSL. I know its quite complicated especially installing with a relay, anyway I brought my own relay (2 pcs). What I mean is that they really give a reasonable pricing on their services. I think they are fair even you are from Singapore or local JB resident. As for this S$ 20.00 gadget , I ask quotation from Sheng Auto Aircon & Accs. they quote me RM250 vs RM 50 from RAMBO. I know from the quotation its not worth installing if from SHENG Auto. From a gadget that is worth S$20 install it at RM 250 is not worth right.",21-10-19

"Just went CarClick on the weekend to check my car as replaced valve cover gasket at 150K KM few months back at CarClick. 



Told Jospeh to check if still got any leaks at mileage 155K Km. Proceeded to hoist vehicle up and found some old stains and at the same area as before and oil pan area also abit damped with oil. 



He diagnosed say might need to reseal oil pan silicon and the valve timing cover which will be good to perform on next servicing. 



Next check valve cover gasket okay, but took out all 4 ignition coil, 

Cylinder 1 was wet with EO and coil 1 was wet also. The rest was dry. 



He say valve cover spoil again, must change again. 

No choice never bring spare gasket so took from them and he help suck out oil from cylinder 1 then proceed to change gasket and wash cover. 



Asked him got put silicon anot, he say last time got put now also will put. 

Not sure how come after 5K Km gasket will leak again. 



Charged me 125RM for the gasket labour 40RM. 

Then told him to perform balancing for front so 10RM



Then point out my front brakes pads left 20% so pass him my new brakes pads and labour was 20RM for each side. 



Total spend was 215RM. About 70 SGD. 



Now CarClick accept credit card already but got surcharge 3%, and they have build a new waiting room for customer. 



Saw their office outside, they carry some aftermarket parts like Tien, D2c engineering works, etc. 



Now they have the obd computer to help scan for error codes. 

Is the big tablet kind. So seems like they have upgraded thier shop. 



I still wondering why the valve cover so fast leak, he quoted me 300RM TO reseal valve cover timing and oil pan. But is 6 hours job.",30-09-19

			With all those parts replaced, your car is as good as having a completely new cooling system. But the problem of losing coolant still persist. Very very strange.



How much coolant is your car losing per week roughly?



Do you still see coolant on the floor or in your engine compartment, ie red or green fluid?



Have u checked the condition of your engine oil recently? Does it look murky?



Most experienced car mechs should be able to pinpoint n solve this type of problem using pressure kit or those uv dye kit.

Hi Koolaid, thanks for your reply.

Usually the coolant went from High to low level between 2-3 weeks. I have top up the expansion tank 3 days ago and inspect everyday so far no leakage.hopefully is just air trap.l



 Carclick did check on the coolant and there was no milky compounds. However , I remember around 8 months ago, I have encounter numerous time of rusty coolant and have done radiator flushing twice but it just keep coming back. I have replaced my radiator just last week and so far no rust found. People in car click top up my coolant with only water and dye usually but still could not find the leakage.",01-10-19

			For those people who are tending to repair Aircon and doing air-con services in Syarikat Fuji Car Cooler. The address is at 15, Jalan Perang, Taman Pelangi, Johor Bahru, 80400, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80400, Malaysia



I have to write this as I saw many people review this aircon workshop and I myself had been overcharged so much by this shop. The price of this shop is even more expensive than Singapore.



My experience is that I brought my Mercedes E200 here on a Saturday morning to fix my air-con. My aircon had no wind for the past few days and I, really rush to fix it. The problem was found out by the shop's uncle which is told by him that my AC Blower was screwed. The uncle in this shop charged me 1500 RM for this AC Blower. I was rush to fix the AC and I somehow accept the price. The problem was fixed.



Later after coming back to Singapore, I asked my friend who selling mercedes-benz parts in Singapore for the quotation of the AC BLower and the price for OEM AC Blower is 185 SGD which a lot cheaper than the shop's uncle charged me. You guys can blame me for my stupidity that I did not ask my friend right-away after receiving the quotation from the uncle. I don't know why but I always tend to believe other people's recommendations and also the uncle in this shop seems to be nice



 



I have no problem with paying 1500 RM = 500 SGD if the price was right. Anw, at least my problem was fixed 



I don't know why so many people give good advice for this shop. I was so disappointed with this shop, feel like being cheated when I was overcharged so much

Sheng Auto is definitely NOT always cheaper than Singapore prices.



Just quote a few examples that I asked them before vs Singapore prices.



putting customised inter neon lighting

wrapping of roof

fixing of dashcam



these 3 jobs that I originally wanted to let them do, end up done in Singapore. due to the fact that the prices (even if) cheaper than SG, only by less than $10 margin. So not worth to drive in Q so bad and for that small margin.



and yes, the waiting time is too long, like some dude above mentioned",17-09-19

"I will be getting a 2009 Toyota Vios. looking at the following. 

- rear camera parking 

- front camera

- body kit

- spoiler at the back

- led lighting at legrooms

- servicing

- reflush of engine oil

- full diagnosis

- alignment?



Any kind souls to rec any workshops? Open to Bukit Indah area as well as I stay Jurong. First car, new to cars and at a loss. Not sure what else I need to keep a lookout at.



Sent from HUAWEI LYA-L29 using GAGT",18-09-19
"First car, then I would suggest splitting into important vs not-important.

Important / Good to do

- servicing

- reflush of engine oil

- alignment

- full diagnosis

But chances are, if you're getting this from a dealer, the first 3 items would've been done already. Full diagnosis, usually hard to say. Would you really go ahead and change everything a workshop says needs to be changed? If the transaction is already confirmed, you should just drive for a while first and take note of any weird sounds that may come up. If all is good, then after 5000km, just do a regular servicing and change the engine oil, and ideally gear oil as well so that you know when it was changed. No need to do an engine flush if it drives well, just change the oil.



Not-important

- rear camera parking

>> if you have rear sensors, it's probably sufficient but this is up to you.

- front camera

>> You can buy any kind of snap-on camera that can be attached to the windscreen and run the USB cable to the cigarette socket yourself. Unless you want those 24/7 recording type that connects to the battery, then you need to be sure your battery is in a good condition.

- body kit

- spoiler at the back

- led lighting at legrooms

>> These are not critical. Do these only after you're very very sure of the condition of your car. Budget for this can be redirected to other actual car parts to get a smoother/better drive (especially shocks, engine mounts, brakes, brake fluid).",18-09-19
"Much appreciated, getting one from direct seller who gotten it less than a month from AML due to relocation. Am sending to mechanic in SG for a check first and taking up add on warranty from elsewhere to cover engine and gearbox since will be using for part time grab. Engine oil seems a bit black. 



Is there any price gauge for servicing? And sheng auto or car click for servicing? Got any other workshop? Thanks so much. Time to study..



Sent from HUAWEI LYA-L29 using GAGT",18-09-19
"Less than a month and then selling already? Sounds iffy to me. But if you get it checked and your trusted mechanic says ok, then it's your call. I suppose Toyotas should be generally ok...

Servicing wise, not sure of the price. Last time I brought my own engine oil and air filters in, just oil filter get from CC.

Sheng Auto does accessories, which is where you can consider going for the whole not-important list.",18-09-19

If it is a msia car and they charge RM80, it will be consider expensive? 

Those ppl in msia is earning the same amt as us. Do you see the average earning $4k x 3 = RM12k? No right. 

Converting it to SGD and comparing with our local price is a bad comparison. 

Yes, RM80 is on the pricing side if u compare to other local msia workshop.",20-09-19

			I'm guessing your engine mounts, assuming you've checked for loose items that could be rattling against the plastic compartments. Easy check to check is to open your bonnet, engage D with someone stepping on the brake for you, and you double-check if the sound is coming from the engine bay.

Or you can drive down to CarClick and ask someone to confirm the problem for you, as well as to get pricing and book an appointment if they are packed or if you don't want to wait.

i just got to know my bumper was bolted permanently, and it cant be removed unless the mechanic remove it forcefully, or by cutting a hole at the bolted area, either way it will need to be filled up (the hole) and respray..

If you plan to own the car for a long period of time. Then change to a new/used bumper (clip on).



The current bumper could be hard silicon to the body which is the cheapest way of repairing.

"Just went to Tyreworld Malaysia Johor Jaya near tebrue to change 2 Tyre. 



Quite a big place with lots of car accessories selling and got free coffee and smoking room to wait while u look out of the mirror can see the Mechanic doing your car. 



The guy ask if I want to add metal valve since I buy 2 pcs trye 

One cost 12RM. Since is cheap why not. 



But want to ask is this a must ? Rubber vs metal valve ?



they gave free 2pcs balancing 

Then I told him do alignment also using hunter machine. 



He say my car 2WD Do front alignment can Liao 



Usually I go car click do front and back for 45RM



He Charge me 35RM For front only. 



Got difference ? Or is he right ?



Was in a hurry so left to shopping after car done. 

Back sg realise one trye cap is lost. Think they might have forget to put it back. 



But still small issue to me since can be purchase at auto shop and mine is dame old already. 



When I look at them change trye, they use hand tool to remove and install the trye not like other shop using air gun type. 



My understand is trye supposed to use hand right instead of the air gun to prevent over tightening.

That's the usual practice.. pay before pump, like give them rm150, pump and then collect balance if any. Malaysians do that too.

18"" tyres will almost always be cheaper in SG unless you go to those chop carrot tyre shops in SG.. 

Rim you can try Carousell for local, if through private seller and you know your rim sizing, offset etc. can sometimes get a good deal.

			Frankly , there are many workshops that charges much lesser than the recommended ones here.. I've been to random workshops in tampoi, permas jaya, and one more near the mydin mall. Their prices were good. I don't go back to the same workshop cos after a while, they develop the 'he can wait la, he will accept the price quoted la' mentality 



Some people feel price quoted rm500 is cheap when they were quoted $300 in SG but actual price might be only rm250, WS up price to rm500 cos 1:3, sinkies will still go ahead.



Different folks, different strokes.





I once had a serious air con issue with my car. Fuji air cooler couldn't find out the problem. A few workshops in SG also couldn't. I went mark cool twice but ah huat wasn't there. I went to a random workshop in tampoi, got it settled at 9pm for rm40. For that price , I would say it's Malaysian price.

I have to write this as I saw many people review this aircon workshop and I myself had been overcharged so much by this shop. The price of this shop is even more expensive than Singapore.



My experience is that I brought my Mercedes E200 here on a Saturday morning to fix my air-con. My aircon had no wind for the past few days and I, really rush to fix it. The problem was found out by the shop's uncle which is told by him that my AC Blower was screwed. The uncle in this shop charged me 1500 RM for this AC Blower.

Later after coming back to Singapore, I asked my friend who selling mercedes-benz parts in Singapore for the quotation of the AC BLower and the price for OEM AC Blower is 185 SGD which a lot cheaper than the shop's uncle charged me. You guys can blame me for my stupidity that I did not ask my friend right-away after receiving the quotation from the uncle. I don't know why but I always tend to believe other people's recommendations and also the uncle in this shop seems to be nice

this is true. ever did tire balancing plus rotation in melaka for like rm20 iirc. 



2+ years ago, when up to PD with a friend. thankfully we were aready in the town area, her discovery's onboard computer started to indicate one of her tires had a problem. suspected it hit a nail, so was losing pressure. when to a nearby tire shop and they fixed the affected tire + balancing + alignment. was expecting the damage to be > rm200 cos it's a conti suv, but surprisingly, her total bill came up to ~ rm100.

			For those people who are tending to repair Aircon and doing air-con services in Syarikat Fuji Car Cooler. The address is at 15, Jalan Perang, Taman Pelangi, Johor Bahru, 80400, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80400, Malaysia



I have to write this as I saw many people review this aircon workshop and I myself had been overcharged so much by this shop. The price of this shop is even more expensive than Singapore.



My experience is that I brought my Mercedes E200 here on a Saturday morning to fix my air-con. My aircon had no wind for the past few days and I, really rush to fix it. The problem was found out by the shop's uncle which is told by him that my AC Blower was screwed. The uncle in this shop charged me 1500 RM for this AC Blower. I was rush to fix the AC and I somehow accept the price. The problem was fixed.



Later after coming back to Singapore, I asked my friend who selling mercedes-benz parts in Singapore for the quotation of the AC BLower and the price for OEM AC Blower is 185 SGD which a lot cheaper than the shop's uncle charged me. You guys can blame me for my stupidity that I did not ask my friend right-away after receiving the quotation from the uncle. I don't know why but I always tend to believe other people's recommendations and also the uncle in this shop seems to be nice



 



I have no problem with paying 1500 RM = 500 SGD if the price was right. Anw, at least my problem was fixed

He suggested me to take the car for a spin or get a trusted Mechanic to see the car before purchasing. Depre 5k.



Is it advisable for me to proceed still and if so, any trusted Mechanic you guys know of who can provide this service?

- complications like compromising FC, comfort etc. 



Not talking abt ralliart turbo and the rare MR, I think the dep for normal cs3 (renewed) should range from 5k to 6.5k depending on condition ba. Of course Sports version looks nicer.

No prob. I would prefer my mech than STA. Before I bought my cs3, brought to CH motor at ubi (Joseph) for checks. Note that his ws is not cheapest and be very packed but I trusted him.

RM30 or RM35.... Can't rem which one.



He carries Lucas oil too. If you are into Lucas oil. Cheaper than i get from carousel... 4L pack.

Myvi is not more than 4L.



BTW, prepare to wait as he and another assistance only.  

Normal EO and filter change should be done less than 30mins if not busy. Then he will do test drive and do all the usual checks before hand over. Estimated up to 60mins in total.

His style is those critical parts/ safety parts and oil leakage, will text (with photo) you if you are not at workshop whether want to do/ repair or not.



Usually, i pass him the hand carry stuffs to him and head to Aeon... There are 3 tune shops nearby and the noise is too loud for me.... hahaha

Factors to consider 

- individual preferences. I prefer stock and rather save the money on wear & tear

- inspection 

- complications like compromising FC, comfort etc. 



Not talking abt ralliart turbo and the rare MR, I think the dep for normal cs3 (renewed) should range from 5k to 6.5k depending on condition ba. Of course Sports version looks nicer.

Suspension

You can either go with lowering springs and change absorbers or coilovers. Be prepared to lose comfort if lowered.



Tires & Rims

Carousell for 2nd hand, check for warped rims, year of manufacture for tires. 15/16 inch tires are slightly cheaper in JB. They do carry a good selection of replica rims as well.



Exhaust System

Get something legal with cert. Inspection is yearly. Do your intake first, consider a high flow filter like K&N.

Look underneath your front bumper area and see if there are any plastic flap that is dislodged or not in its place. 



Physically touch these flaps (watch where you are touching). You should be able to replicate the sound that you're hearing if it's the part that came loose.



Sound is heard from the front bumper ya? Also check the front wheel fenders area.",03-06-19

Then technically you could buy the parts from a stockist and head in to JB to get it done. Expect to shave a minimum of 30% from those listed prices if you spend your own time to do it instead of simply heading in to a workshop. If it's enticing enough for you, and since it's only for 2 years, factor in the ""worst case basis"" and if that still works out for you, just go for it. It's a common enough car to not have to worry about availability of parts or possibility that any regular workshop can't settle it.",23-05-19

yes. for very very small leaks, some shops will recommend to use the sealant. they will usually ""drain"" all the old refrigerant first, and then fill up it up with sealant, and then top it off with the appropriate refrigerant. 



and small leaks means every few weeks need to top up the refrigerant. if its a big leak, dont waste time on sealant. 



few years back, my friends car was facing the same issue. new coil replacement was close to 2k. but his leak was small, ie every 2 or 3 weeks need to top up. so the aircon shop recommended using the sealant. wasnt expensive. less than 100 iirc. and it worked for close to 2 years before he scraped his bm.",23-05-19

Worst case scenario of leaking from cooling coil. New parts not worth changing since left 6mths, and they do not keep old cooling coils as odds of getting a defective one can be high-ish. Also installing a new cooling coil takes 1.5days.

You can stop the Data auto renewal via the app.

Wait for the Happy Hour RM50 offer. At the same time validity will be extended by 50 days.

Season pass is sort of like a bank. You withdraw the data when you want to use it.



Give you example,



To withdraw data via myxox app

FAT1 is 1GB/30days (auto renewal)

FAT2 is 2GB/30days  (auto renewal)

FAT5 is 5GB/30days (auto renewal)

FAT10 is 10GB/30days  (auto renewal)

FAT500 is 500mb/30days  (auto renewal)

FATW2 is 2GB/7days (NO auto renewal)

FATD1 is daily (cannot choose this)



Then after subscribe, go to unsubscribe, choose unsubscribe data recurring (auto renew).

"MyDigi 3GB for 24 hours validity is RM3. If you're alone and don't need much, you can also get 300MB for RM1. So depending on your usage, one RM10 topup can use for 5 separate day trips (after 6% SST, you get RM9.43 in your balance - first topup validity extended, so RM1 for 300MB, then 4 times of RM1 for extend validity and RM1 for 300MB). For long trips, you can subscribe to those 7-day packages and it's quite worth it.

You can try Edge Euro. They Do MB, VW, BMW and Mini.

Contact them over FB. 

Ask for a quote then you decide. 

It is very difficult for bro to tell you or even give you an estimate of labour cost and parts.



Since is your first time, please leave your expectation in sg. i.e JB workshop  environment maybe not as conducive as some in sg.  







Unless, is the usual EO and filter change service, labour should be below RM80.

Oil and filter you provide.

			I would avoid using them for the time being. They used to be quite good previously (like last year) and I have been consistently using them but recently their standards have dropped like mad.



First was the long wait (which I am ok since already in JB, spending 20 minutes won't hurt right?), then after that I noticed that the boss brought in new helpers but they don't seem to have any knowledge of proper car washing. My friend even commented that when the worker dropped the cloth on the floor, he would still pick it up and continue cleaning instead of using another cloth.



Yesterday was the final straw, I had feedback the the interior of the car was not vacuumed properly and the mat was not even taken out to 'dust it'. Yes, RM15 is 'cheap' but I knw that the car wash stations at Pelangi petrol station could do even a much better job than D'Lux.



If you are interested, probably can try Supwave as recommended by my friend. I heard that a lot of Honda Shuttle car owners go there to wash.

Would suggest skip dlux too. Was their supporter when they first opened (although they took quite long to finish washing). They were extremely detailed last time. Around last year their job start to be sloppy. I go in probably one a month or once every 2 month so I not sure when did I notice it but quite a few times they never wipe dry enough causing water marks, door edge all still got water, interior vacuum also just for sake of vacuum. So it's not a one time incident as 2 trips for me would be around 1-2 months time gap.

My frd drove a Forester and after the free servicing given by MI, Uses Subaru AD in JB. Charged abit more as compared with local registered car plate but cheaper than MI Singapore. MI Singapore still accept the warranty. 



Other brands of cars, maybe you have to visit them or call. Personally, Johor ADs should accept. 

The pricing and warranty(If your car still within warranty, SG AD accept it or not), you should find out more.

I would avoid using them for the time being. They used to be quite good previously (like last year) and I have been consistently using them but recently their standards have dropped like mad.



First was the long wait (which I am ok since already in JB, spending 20 minutes won't hurt right?), then after that I noticed that the boss brought in new helpers but they don't seem to have any knowledge of proper car washing. My friend even commented that when the worker dropped the cloth on the floor, he would still pick it up and continue cleaning instead of using another cloth.



Yesterday was the final straw, I had feedback the the interior of the car was not vacuumed properly and the mat was not even taken out to 'dust it'. Yes, RM15 is 'cheap' but I knw that the car wash stations at Pelangi petrol station could do even a much better job than D'Lux.



If you are interested, probably can try Supwave as recommended by my friend. I heard that a lot of Honda Shuttle car owners go there to wash.",30-04-19

It's a regular shophouse lot, thus max park 3 cars for them to work on at any time. Fees are reasonable but as I've experienced, a speaker wire got loose after a few months.

workshop changed T-iv instead of WS for my Altis.



Im so pissed. They say it is okay and ask me to return to change back to WS if im worried.



Now my gearbox is diluted with T-iv (up to 50%). Read through forums and conclusion is both are not compatible and should not be mixed.



I think i will change back to WS, next servicing (5000km) drain and top up WS again. what u guys think?

I used to think that ATF lasts a lifetime, as the label says so as well.



Then I wondered, if there's a mileage definition for ""lifetime"". Since COE lasts for 10 years, I decided on this definition for ""lifetime"" and I went for an ATF change, then adopted a routine of ATF change every 30kkm.



Not bad I would say, gear changes are more responsive after the change. Perhaps I just want to prolong the transmission lifespan and not wanting it to fail as the mileage climbs. You know how much does a transmission replacement cost at BM? 



... I'd rather change ATF than to replace transmission.",16-04-19

Now at Ah Yuan here. Got 1 Vios like do overhaul wor.,11-04-19
"Recently I experienced something strange - my left speakers would crackle/distort when driving over bumpy roads. It would sound normal/great when stationary. So 2 Saturdays ago I visited Sheng Auto. Jackson sat in a test drive and told me that he suspected that my amplifier was faulty. But that day he was packed and didn't have time to even check further.



Even though I suspected it was the speaker's wiring, I wasn't sure and proceeded to get a replacement amp because I trusted his diagnosis, and also partly because I wanted it changed anyway as one of the channels isn't working. Later on, my friend suggested that I try to change the inputs and channels between left and right to confirm whether it's the speakers or the amp. Turns out, the problem remained on the left side. Oh well.



So on Tuesday I went to try out 2 audio/accessories shop and now gonna share for you guys reference.



1. Elegant Auto Sound, near CarClick (can find on Google Maps)

- asked the guy to replace my existing amplifier with another one

- asked the guy to check the wiring of my left speakers

- asked the guy to see if the audio whine can be solved with something I brought along

- asked the guy to try installing a remote control for the headunit

- asked for a price estimate and he said between RM100-200 depending on what he hears for himself

- saw a SG plate in front of me, so thought he shouldn't be too bad. agreed and left the place with another friend to CarClick to replace his car's spark plugs (which took like 1 hour + because had to wait for the dispatch to send the plugs, my friend wasn't too impressed)

- came back about 2 hours later to find the amplifier replaced, but the front speakers had left/right inputs wrongly connected - ok no problem, can just swap it myself

- sounded like the audio whine was gone, but found out later on that it was because amplifier gain wasn't increased

- the guy said there wasn't anything wrong with the left speakers

- the add-on remote was installed and then removed because he said it wasn't compatible - will need to try this again as there is something setting in the headunit to program the keys

- damage RM80

- probably partly my own fault for not staying there to see exactly what he did

- but likely won't revisit because of the next shop I visited



2. Yaw Audio Accessories, near Taman Sentosa

- after I found that that left speakers still crackled, my friend recommended to this shop (which he later told me he has been frequenting them for almost 12 years)

- was lucky they weren't attending to anyone else when I arrived

- told them about my left speakers crackling when road is bumpy

- they proceeded to check the amp and said it was all ok

- after I suggested twice that I suspect it's the speaker's wiring, they checked the left front speaker, and true enough, found one of the wires breaking off without much force. proceeded to re-wire that, and so far the crackling speaker issue is fixed

- damage RM65

- could probably have saved some if I went to just this 2nd shop

- will probably revisit them because they are the only shop so far who recommended that I install some line suppressor to try to fix the audio whine/aeroplane sound, which would cost another RM65 labour and RM20 for the part if it works

- even Sheng Auto just told me it's probably due to the headunit and there's nothing they can do (they are the ones who ran the amplifier and speaker cables)

- downside with Yaw is they are quite hardsell with some of their stuff, but can always say no and they don't change attitude if you say no

- plus side is they advise the pricing up front before doing anything



So this little exercise I spent a bit of unnecessary money here and there, just to find some alternatives. Looks like I may visit Yaw more often - more easily accessible, and more time definite. A little more pricey perhaps, but better than being told no time slot after driving all the way there.

Will update again if I visit Yaw a second time.",11-04-19
"Nice.... Thanks for the updates... 

For Sheng Auto you need to make appt. Else either wait or gonna come back another time.

Sheng Auto is getting busy as compared 1.5 years ago when i first visited him without any appt made. No cars in his shop during my first visit and the repair was done like 30mins and left a happy. Maybe i am lucky.



Nowadays, i would make appt with Jackson before driving there, even though, have to prepare to wait for a couple of hours before the ride is done.",11-04-19

2. King's motorsport. Search them in FB. They carries Thinkware

3. Buy a used set over carousel and get it done either at Sheng auto or sg. SG installation charges not more than $100.

what's the manufacturing date code of the batt? its usually found on the box and tag. if you did not keep the tab, the code is also heat stamped on the side of the battery lid. look out for a string of 5-8 chars.

LCH Brother 

NYK auto

Tyreworld

Tryemart 



Only LCH and trye world accept credit card the rest pay by cash. 



Usually I put old tyres at the back then new pair in front 

So that the front new will wear our faster to the same as rear old tyres. 



Then u can rotate next time and prolong the old tyres lifespan. 



When buy from them try to ask free balancing and alignment 

Usually is free balancing only, alignment free when u buy 4pcs.",22-03-19

Depends where i visiting, did mine frequently on the following shops:-



1. Syarikat Lim Chin Hin

Jalan Pingai Taman Pelangi

80400 Johor Bahru, Johor.



2. BC Tyres & Rim. (Find them on FB)



Usullay, i goes to the first shop if am/ around custom area. After shop, wash car pump petrol and return.



For the 2nd shop, if i have time and craving for laska. Is a distance away.



Personally, i changed front set tires once at 2nd shop months back. Comes with free balance and only discounted alignment (sighzz). 

Buy 4 tires, free alignment and balancing.   

Recently, returned for usual wheel alignment/ rotation/ balance. The shop boss suggest dun need rotate, next round then rotate with the rear set as rear is old set. I think he suggest that to keep all 4 tires worn evenly down then next time change all fours tgt... Business mind.... lolz

My colleague just renewed 10years on his 2.0L camry. Parf value +body + PQP.

All in, dep per year around 7k+.



Yeah, road tax is up 10% every year from 11th ~ 15th years. Subsequent, 16th year on wards to 10th year, at what you paid on the 15th year.



Personally, there is risks as you don't really know the ""heath"" condition of this car. 

I was thinking of what you thinking too... Buy something like 8yo or 9 yo car, drive drive then renew...

Yap, if you don't mind a 5-10 mins walk, go through Jalan Wira 5 (small road right in front of Carclick) towards the main road.



Nice coffeeshop similar to Yakun

My AD in SG did that to my car too as I sat in the car and we went out to diagnose certain noises which I reported. 

Really can't expect mechanics to drive the car like it's their own, regardless of how much you pay. My theory is the gearbox is made to withstand a certain level of abuse throughout its life and I know I don't abuse my gearbox on a daily basis.

Yeah that's what I did. Ordered my dashcam online. Spent quite some time this week running around to collect the stuff, buy SD card etc.

My car has always been taken care of by AD so I'm not very used to JB workshops. It seems the recommended ones won't give black face if you bring your own parts. RM70 vs SGD50, about half price. Worth my trip as I'll go do other leisure stuff at the same time.

			I would recommend LCH. My car consistently dies, stall at traffic light, at times crank but wouldn't start. Went there through HWZ recommendation. They diagnosed, and found out ""CRANKSHAFT SENSOR"" malfunctioned. I also mentioned that I'm renewing COE so check what is needed to change. Those that needs to change, he point them out and those that still can be used he say no need to change. I personally think he (Ah Yuan) is honest and reliable. Pricing is very reasonable (coz I did ask SG workshop too), unlike some which are overpriced and poor workmanship too.I think all his mechanics are hardworking since they put in effort in repair and also handle your car professionally. Anw, Its a 25-30mins drive across Woodlands Checkpoint. I think contact them prior before coming so they can know whats the problem and prepare for your car's arrival. 



Here's the address & contact person in case if you need.

2 options I can think of.



A. Buy all parts in sg and bring it to ah yuan to install.



B. Get ah yuan to buy all parts and install. U should text him and get a quote first.

If Power window + electric curtain(factory) faulty, can go to BTS spray paint. Spray paint shops usually fix those cars involved in accident.

I would recommend LCH. My car consistently dies, stall at traffic light, at times crank but wouldn't start. Went there through HWZ recommendation. They diagnosed, and found out ""CRANKSHAFT SENSOR"" malfunctioned. I also mentioned that I'm renewing COE so check what is needed to change. Those that needs to change, he point them out and those that still can be used he say no need to change. I personally think he (Ah Yuan) is honest and reliable. Pricing is very reasonable (coz I did ask SG workshop too), unlike some which are overpriced and poor workmanship too.I think all his mechanics are hardworking since they put in effort in repair and also handle your car professionally. Anw, Its a 25-30mins drive across Woodlands Checkpoint. I think contact them prior before coming so they can know whats the problem and prepare for your car's arrival.

No leaks change for what, told me to just change the atf fluid first and 60k then change everything. Save the $$ so changed atf fluid, engine oil + filter and top up bit of coolant. Price was VERY REASONABLE and he took the car for a short spin to make sure everything was good to go after changing the oil. Wanted to tip him for kopi but decided not to spoil the market. 



Went on a weekday though, reached his workshop around 10am. Fast and furious job done, will go back to him for my next 10k engine oil change.

ah yuan is trustworthy. many here have gone to him for servicing, troubleshooting and parts replacement. i am his customer as well.



one advice. if any shop offer u to flush engine and tranny, DO NOT PROCEED. for most jap cars, if you service the engine and tranny regularly, i dont see a need for flushing. my wife's gs300 has more than 200k km on it today. no issues with the engine and tranny cos I sent it for servicing promptly. the only time it didnt start was due to bad batt.",19-02-19

Wa price of my JB car wash. Dunno if Malacca practice the SG plate ""premium surcharge"" policy or not. 

The most say you are SG PR so still considered local. For me I can't speak Malay, Chinese CMI in SG, go JB the Chinese service staff speak to me in English 30 seconds into the conversation. No choice go Malaysia sure kana pay ""Sinkie surcharge"", sometimes just to get them to say a few keywords in English. 



That's why now I tell the kids being able to speak proper Mandarin is very important and not just get by with mixing a bit of English into Mandarin conversations.",19-02-19

Hey, buddy thanks for your opinion, I think we have different surroundings /budget/expectation. for years I have used workshops that do the basic EO and filter for under $15 labour, yes this price is relationship price. 



locally EO and filter under $50 (parts + labour) are possible at pioneer/woodlands workshop area,  nearby where I stay. Sin Ming, Bukit Batok, or any workshop within 2km of inspection centres tend to be expensive.  SIC 



Budget shops are often at high rise workshops, high high levels where their rental is cheap and the main revenue is not from maintenance. Also possible if their shop is deep inside the industrial estate.



It is just 1 bolt to loosen and large pliers to remove the oil filter. How much for 10 mins effort? Yes, I am a cheapskate.   I don't critique friends who spend close to $200 on ""branded"" quality; their money, their peace of mind. 



I have the capability to do it myself too, as I am willing to go under the car, further lowering the cost to below $40 if I pick up Fully-EO from our Supermarket during a promotion. 



I guess you are suggesting I got lucky that the gentlemen were free and able to diagnosis, thus my good review may be one-off. or maybe you are suggesting that this service I experienced is common in JB, nothing to rave about. 



sorry- i habitually type in paragraphs, not shooting. i also realise this thread is on JB workshops, oops.

on the topic of a car wash, my friends patronise 10RM car wash near Sentosa area, is there any budget wash near to Paradigm / Aeon Indah that opens till 10 plus?



I'm not particular, I just don't like a layer of greyish ash on the car every time after JB. It does not go away after heavy rain or splashing water. no problem with 1 sponge to wash the whole car etc.



I know about R&R Auto Detailer Centre Indah at 17RM+

You are right. When I park my car further down , and walk to workshop to ask about prices in Malay and car model etc, their price will be A.





A few mins later when I drive in with my SG plate car, they will tell me sorry I quote wrongly or this car model abit different and price will be ( A + rm20 to rm50)

  can't be helped, shops open in these areas to cater to the deeper pockets, demand for convenience, comfort, speed and lack of basic Bahasa. within 2km of CIQ, is pretty much little SGtown in Malaysia.



If one really heads to places that serve locals, I think the amenities, products and services will be below the acceptable standard for most Singaporean's tolerance.

 i confirmed with my friends, never quote wrongly, their car 10-15RM to unscrew an oil filter, and open 1 bolt then replace accordingly. If I go with them maybe the mechanic will give him face. I think easier if I buy a number plate and replace it when i'm inside JB.



when I go in with my friend everything is cheaper than quoted to the typical Singaporean. Maybe that's why my concept of prices makes you all frustrated. 



example, for similar size, 1 tin of CNY cookies Singapore sell $15, my relatives bought several, RM15 each already celebrating. I went in with friend, blur blur just buy some- in bulk we bought 5RM per item...taste wise, I just said its from M'sia, guests say delicious.

CC's pricing is very reasonable given the quality of work. my 2 cents. agree with your fr and most folks here. ah yuan is pretty good with troubleshooting and doesn't ask u to change this and that unnecessarily. been going to him for > 2 yrs now, when he was with another shop with the xmm. now no more xmm to beo liao. 



some mech in malaysia charge you the same reasonable price for labor. and when it comes to simple things like tire rotation, they couldnt even do it properly. my friend kena recently. all 4 rims were found with scratches and deep marks near the bolts. wah he kpkb to us, very heart pain. paid a few k his 20"", only < 6 months old, and all 4 rims have deep scratches and marks on them. knn.",14-02-19

Also, their prices are transparent n closer to local price than the tourist, though not the cheapest. ok la once I see the pictures, they got no XMM, no wifi, no lounge, no team of 5-10 blur young boys, the cheapskate in me says  lets go!

For me never had this issue bro, did throttle body cleaning once at the Woodlands shop for my sister's SUV(RX300) and once for my own FD Civic in JB. Your coolant level was probably low(or at least below max) from before I'm guessing? Did you ask him to top up?",30-01-19

Never instruct him to topup coolant actually. 

I already ask him TOP up reservoir 2 weeks before. 

Before he clean tb I was checking my reservoir it was at 3/4 mark to F



Den suddenly he called me say want coolant ask me got anot. 

Then I go see my reservoir it drop like to 1/4. 



Then he explain need topup coolant after clean tb. 

He topup at radiator cap there not my reservoir.

"As with all old belts, it is slightly stretched resulting in a little slippage during start. This produces the sound which goes away once the rpm is constant.



Msia mindset is: what for tighten an old belt just to get rid of the sound, when it will risk reducing the lifespan of the belt (tighter = more strain on the belt). And it is a waste of $$$ to change belt when the old one can still be used.



I don't think the workshop is wrong in that sense, maybe they did not explain the rationale properly.



You have to be specific in Msia, if you want them to tighten or change a new belt, make sure you say so.",28-01-19

Aiyo... I dreamt that my roof wrap was full of air bubbles last night 



I went a few times, this workshop is always busy and there's always cars to work with. Workmanship wise, pls monitor closely.



e.g. I did door soundproofing, asked them to check if there's any loose parts causing a vibration sound in the door... not done. Personally went to check and picked the debris myself before the guy seal up the door with soundproofing material 



Hands-on workers seems overwhelmed, overheard worker ranting to boss when boss ask him to work on another car after finishing what he is doing. Hesitated a few times when I wanted to install some gauges there due to this and eventually didn't do my installation there. 



Wrap is cheap and fast. So far no issues. I did a roof wrap - RM120 and bonnet - RM88. HOWEVER, they sprayed some liquid while performing the wrap and my grill's paint sort of faded. Aiyo..... I think I will never go back there again.",29-01-19

			Went to CarClick yesterday. Due to miscomm with Singapore stockist, I got to run around in Singapore a bit before departing for JB. Reached CarClick at 2 plus.  Car handed over to Ah Hong and he started work on my car right away. There were a few Malaysian cars that were being worked on, probably waiting for parts.



Work done: replace EO, EO filter, air filter, spark plugs, CVT fluid, CVT filter, rear shocks pair, brake fluid, coolant. Also did alignment. Labour fee total rm235. Parts some i bring some they source oem parts which I'm ok with. All in took 3.5 hours.



They spotted the CVT fluid I brought was wrong spec. Turned out there are 2 Toyota CVT fluid with very similar packaging. He sourced the correct fluid for me. It is slightly more expensive than getting direct from stockist but not exorbitantly so. Acceptable mark up. 



Very good experience overall.

LCH Batteries and Tyres quoted me RM120 for the labour bro, I supply part. If get part from them it varies quite a bit depending if genuine, OEM, used part. If you car not left long and you don't mind used I managed to find a scrapyard in JB that sources all their parts from half cuts of SG cars. Cheap parts, how long it'll last is a ?  Although excellent for panel parts/lamps etc. I  got my power steering pump used for RM280. 



LCH batteries and tyres had quoted RM500 for used part with labour, CarClick when I'd dropped by a week back was RM580. I got LTEN PRO to quote but the quote was a bit arbitrary over the phone..he like didn't have a figure so just agar and said RM200 for labour, I supply part. Hawk Tayar said must bring down and supervisor can quote in store. I might pop by one of their outlets on the way to LCH Batteries and tyres to see how they quote since their labour quite standard.



One odd thing though, my ps fluid reservoir had started dropping and I'd have to top up after parked overnight. Had it checked, power steering pump leaking. After a few days of leaking while I sourced the pump, the last few days, ps fluid reservoir has been the same level..super weird..now I have a used ps pump in my boot and am unsure if to replace.  I'll let the workshops have a second look and determine what's going on..can't do much without getting under the car.

Although excellent for panel parts/lamps etc. I  got my power steering pump used for RM280. 



LCH batteries and tyres had quoted RM500 for used part with labour, CarClick when I'd dropped by a week back was RM580. I got LTEN PRO to quote but the quote was a bit arbitrary over the phone..he like didn't have a figure so just agar and said RM200 for labour, I supply part. Hawk Tayar said must bring down and supervisor can quote in store. I might pop by one of their outlets on the way to LCH Batteries and tyres to see how they quote since their labour quite standard.



One odd thing though, my ps fluid reservoir had started dropping and I'd have to top up after parked overnight. Had it checked, power steering pump leaking. After a few days of leaking while I sourced the pump, the last few days, ps fluid reservoir has been the same level..super weird..now I have a used ps pump in my boot and am unsure if to replace.  I'll let the workshops have a second look and determine what's going on..can't do much without getting under the car.

Maybe the rust/dirt inside the PS system some how clogged up the leaking point, then leakage stopped

 that was my guess also...something might have clogged it..at first I thought maybe water from the rain plus dust/dirt combined and dried to form a sort of paste on the outside.  Will check again later this evening to see if any drop in the reservoir.",23-01-19

Hey, check this list out for shop contacts-

For your oil pump leak you can contact CarClick Garage, TS Motor, LTEN PRO among others, these are highly recommended. For the air con fan can ask Sheng Auto or Syarikat Fuji Car Cooler. They can quote you for the repair and you can decide if worth it, can also ask the shop about leaving the car with them overnight. Not too sure myself but I think is usually okay.",12-01-19

Oh, btw if just labour required to fix the issues then JB is surely worth it but if you require part replacement, get them to quote you for used parts or OEM since you only have till end of this year to use. If buying OEM can check the part cost in SG stockist also. Sometimes will be cheaper than JB. In that case can buy the part in SG and just get labour quote for the job from the JB shop.



Edit: on reading up, it's just the oil pump seal that needs changing and most of the cost is the labour. Although if you're changing the pump itself then above applies. Air con fan issue also they can sort out for you. Don't think you need to worry about parts. That said, my current experience with used part sourcing is going a bit poorly..need a power steering pump, CarClick quoted RM580 for used part with install, checked a used part shop in SG they tell me the part is $250 ... hard to find parts for my car though. Will probably just get it done at CarClick if I can't find any cheaper, trying to check with JB stockists directly but no luck yet.

Take photo and send details of your car to Sheng Auto. Sheng Auto is a accessories shop but i did see Jackson replace front bumper of a SG car before. 

Contact him to check if he can do it for you. 



This SG car owner also buy direct from KL and ship to Sheng Auto. Jackson just provide labour to change it.",13-01-19

			Hi, I did my servicing today in S'pore and was told that my engine oil pump leaking and one of my air con fan is not working. Repair cost is $200 and $120. 



Do you think it's worth going to JB to do the repair, since I'm going in next weekend? So far never tried b4, has always been servicing in S'pore.



Btw, do the workshop allow us to leave the car overnight and collect next day? Cos my hotel got no parking available.



Else any recommendation where to park overnight? I search forum some ppl say KSL mall and holiday villa... any advice?



Thanks!

Depends also where you stay and also space available in the workshop and relationship with the owner of that workshop. Unless is confirmed that they will park your ride overnight inside their workshop, then worth.",13-01-19

While Q up for check at SG custom, chatted with the officer and he mentioned small qty is ok lah... 

He further told him he came across one car with one whole big basket of durain, then this is taxable lah. 



During CNY, BBQ pork/chicken slice (Bak kua) is popular, this is not allowed even for own consumption. That was years back experience, 

Not sure still applies now.

Hi, don't buy any servicing package for Malaysia. The engine oil there is more ex than SG and since that's the bulk of the cost, it becomes more expensive to get them to supply the oil. 



What most of us who service in JB do is buy engine oil from a supermarket/etc. on discount then bring it to JB and only get the shop to do labour(plus supply filter if you want convenience for a few SGD extra or you can buy your own oil filter from stockist in SG and bring). 



For points based checks, discuss with the mechanic. Should have no issue doing. They normally just change oil and filter and point out only the things they notice and check things based on your feedback. Labour for servicing alone(you provide oil plus filter) ranges from RM25-40. Can check CarClick Garage or even Hawk Tayar.",08-01-19

Depends on what type of car you have. The safety bars varies.



Rear top - if saloon car it's called a boot bar. If MPV it's just call rear bar.



Rear bottom - also called anti roll bar.

Then the MY version sites of Shopee and Lazada etc. :

https://shopee.com.my/

Then google generally with keywords like malaysia, selangor, johor, etc. and find shop contacts as a lot(most?) MY shops don't list online so need to check if they have something by calling or messaging.

Then if still need, last ditch is Facebook groups for Malaysia buy/sell, can list wanted ad or source some shop from the postings. Some are very active, see by number of members and join the most populated ones.

Not readily available at spare parts shop in JB area? 



I came across once at Sheng Auto, a sg customer ordered front bumper from KL for his kimchi ride and get Jackson to fix up. Parts shipped directly to Sheng Auto.

End up, colour mis-matched and worst not 100% can fit his ride. LL, wasted whole day. Maybe he is unlucky



Just a suggestion, if is consumable parts, get thru workshops or local spare parts shop.",04-01-19

No worries, yup, can contact them to ask for shipping but will have to pay first to their bank account. Best to go to the bank ATM and do cash deposit and send them the photo of the transfer slip cos it's immediate. Background check the shop before making and transfer though. I usually ship to JB straight to the workshop to do and I check with the workshop if it's ok. Cheaper to ship to JB also, only like RM20 for not too heavy box, don't know their POSLaju thresholds though.",05-01-19

			The decision the bosses make is along the lines of, if increase price, how many customers will stop coming vs how much more revenue from increased price. So if they have 10 regulars each doing competitively priced work for average $100 each month, they make $1000 but if they increase price by 30% they will make $130 each and if they lose 2 regulars, they still make $1040, scaled up to how much work they really do.. Can be a lot.. Those that know pricing and carrot pricing will stop going but majority hear reputed name they'll go without comparing. The shops also usually do this when they can afford to lose business because they are already turning people away cos too many jobs. 







Yeh, it boils down to the honesty and integrity of the boss.. If they get greedy then it's bound to happen.. That said, I just went to Sheng and Jackson is really a top notch guy. Very honest and humble. Even though he told me my job roughly rm150, when he did he came and told me only need rm80 because the job no complications. If he'd not said anything also I'd have just paid the rm150 and been OK. 







Can buy car wash package also bro, cheaper. I bought regular wash one, the rm15 one,  8 washes plus 1 free so 9 total for rm100 so only rm11 each. They have package for Meguiars one also I think rm200 for 9 washes, but have to confirm. 

The slim lady with kid is Steven's wife I think 



That's one thing I really like about D'Lux, little to no queue  the workers also are thorough. 



Opticoat is paint protection. It protects the paint from bird shÂ¡t, prevents dirt buildup. Makes the car very easy to wash and when wash it'll look like new(if your paint was good when you did it). It's basically a sacrificial layer on the outside like wax but can last 3-5yrs depending on the labour and product. Gives the car a nice, very smooth, glass like finish. They were having end of year promo.. Dunno still have or not  rm840 for sedan.

Okay, next time go will ask the slim lady if got meguair packages.

Will go BTS do touch up and polishing first.

Using turtle wash n wax hacking 

Pour some inside spray water bottle and clean up using micro fibre cloth then finish up by using dry cloth.

Best is stay there to see what they are doing. 

If u leave your car there, they might take shortcuts. 



Apply to car wash and workshop. 

Stay and see what they are doing at least you know they not taking shortcut. 



Anyway is stay for 30mins then say u go buy thing nearby be back in 30mins. 

But is go shopping 2 hours then come back. 



This also will make them fear and dunno when u come back. 



The only place I leave my car before is to ah yuan and Jospeh. 

They will WhatsApp u when car ready for collect. 



If you go to the shop often then should be okay. 

Else just stay at the shop be sercuirty guard",03-01-19

Car handed over to Ah Hong and he started work on my car right away. There were a few Malaysian cars that were being worked on, probably waiting for parts.



Work done: replace EO, EO filter, air filter, spark plugs, CVT fluid, CVT filter, rear shocks pair, brake fluid, coolant. Also did alignment. Labour fee total rm235. Parts some i bring some they source oem parts which I'm ok with. All in took 3.5 hours.



They spotted the CVT fluid I brought was wrong spec. Turned out there are 2 Toyota CVT fluid with very similar packaging. He sourced the correct fluid for me. It is slightly more expensive than getting direct from stockist but not exorbitantly so. Acceptable mark up.

Just want to add that for my case Ah Hong saw the shock bush spoilt, and recommended to change. So they will check and change if necessary. 



Anyway Singapore also has good workshops that don't ask you to change parts that are still ok. But they are still more exp. What to do, rent and labour more exp in Sgp.

For my car, I dropped it off at about 3.30pm and hung around a short while. Left at 4pm to go Giant across the road. Came back at 8pm(they'd told me 3hrs or so) and they were still doing. Waited another 30-40mins. 



The estimate time is 3hours for polish and wax but depends on your car paint. Mine was bad condition so took them longer. They seem to do the job properly, no fixed timing cutoff where they spend a certain amount of time on the car then move on.



After hanging around there for a bit, I deemed D'Lux to be safe. They only have like 3 or 4 workers so it's not like those petrol station rm10 car wash where they got anywhere from 5-10 guys working at any one time. That one they may not know who the owner is and have been reported to give the key to thieves. Idiots have even, at times, tried to give me someone else's key. Wasted not Maserati or what, I'd trade in.  

There are some rm10 car washes that have implemented anti-theft measures such as issuing key rings for the key so only the person who gave the key can take it back. D'Lux doesn't have that though but I don't think they need it.",03-01-19

I suspect end of year tends to be a backlog period for many spray shops. I figure it's a combination of factors like more people booking cars in for long repair/spray work in December(overseas trip etc, affected less by downtime) and perhaps some of their workers might go a break during this period too?",03-01-19

Personally, I wouldn't say ex. Just not dirt cheap. Which is logical for the quality of work done. It's very fair, imo. A lot of my price comparisons are from when Ah Yuan was at LCH Bros so not sure if still the same but I find sometimes his stockist prices for certain parts(OEM also) can be a bit more. 



My rear wheel bearing Ah Yuan quoted was RM380 genuine/RM280 OEM/RM60 labour if part provided. I got done at my alternate workshop that I find equal quality and skill, TS Motor, as their quote was RM330 genuine/RM230 OEM/RM60 labour if part provided. RM50 not very much when converted to SGD but it's a third of my petrol tank refilled there.",03-01-19

After shopping at City Square Mall, went Dâ€™Lux for car wash at 9:30pm

Took up the 30Rm meguair wash, car clean clean and very bright. 

About 20mins job for a car wash interior and exterior. 



By far I think is the value for money wash.

3 fingers is good. Only down side to lowering springs is that you won't be able to adjust the damping rate, so you gotta go really slow at humps. If it's not good enough, you can add in those spring cushion buffer... although not really recommended

Jb Seevicing means oil change only. Other than oil change, you will need to know what else you want to change. They may go through your car and see what needs to be replaced . Mech will test drove and take a look around the engine Bay and under carriage to determine. In most cases, if no major repair, a few hours is more than adequate for them to complete the job.

JB workshops do not follow what SG or AD those what 100k servicing. Usually, the normal EO change, fluid change. 

If you die die, what to follow 100k servicing, Tell them what other stuffs you WANT to change, other than the EO change and make a appointment. 



In JB, the workshop will tell/ advise you what must change or can tahan till next EO change then replace, after they test drive your car after EO change.

Flushing needs some sort of equipment. No equipment cannot leh. No use Carclick before, so dun know if they have this equipment.

If renew, just like changing EO, drain and top up new fluid with new filter. Any workshop can do.

Most of the time I go JB do my car but I do keep one guy number in my phonebook for emergency use in sg in case breakdown. 



So far I tried 2 local workshop, the first is out of my list after leaving minor scratch inside my interior when changing Gear shift cable. 



The 2nd one is intro by my another Friend who drive the same car as me.

Went there to install front and rear strut bar for 30 bucks labour fee. 



The Mechanic look nerdy type no hard sell and good service. 

There was once I was having coolant issues. Coolant reservoir keep dropping slowly. So went there 2 times. 



First was topup coolant and he ask me monitor few days. 

Did not charge me as I bring own coolant. 



2nd time went there again he help to do pressure test for free. 

There told me my radiator cap and reservoir cap spoil. 



So change the cap on the spot for me. 

Pay him 20 dollars. 



Problem solves, coolant level okay. 

Even tell me to take note of certain things for my car. 



Every time I leave the ws will give me complimentary ticket to exit the area. 

When leaving ws, will also help to guide my car out and wave bye bye.

Just saw their google reviews, most recent all about their steep price hike. Sad but a lot of good shops once they become popular start to find they can widen their profit margin by chopping carrot instead of sticking to honest workmanship. I get that ultimately that's what a business needs to do so price increases are the obvious way to go once established but it can't be exorbitant and the worst is when they start telling you to replace things that really don't need change.",30-12-18

I used to go to them regularly for 6 years,good rapport with uncle yong, ah yao, the air con fellow and accessories youngster..until their prices went up despite me being their regular customers.. 



Some workshops are cheaper than sg. But still cut throat. For example , if let's say the price in sgd is $100 and Malaysia's price is rm100, the ws will sell u saying it's rm200 and will be quick to add on 'in sg it's $100, about rm300 you know, I sell only rm200'.



Some Singaporeans will still change cos it's still cheaper. But to me, it's carrot pricing.



One famous accessories shop suddenly raised price of the gear knob by rm30 (price tag printed on product was rm50) when they saw my car was a sg plate. Citing the price tag printed was 'Old'. I parked my car further when enquiring price. When I drove my car in, price rm80 liao. And the aunty was quick to say ' sg mahal kan? Sini lagi murah '

			Hi guys,

My COE Mazda 323 aircon has on and off hissing sound. 

Read in this forum recommended JB ac shops are Sheng Auto

& Sykt Fuji Car Cooler.The posts I saw were sometime in 2017.

Are these shops still there, and still reliable?

Have been down on luck so need to watch expenses.

Thanks for your kind input.

To Hellhunter, sentsggirls & myviowner, thanks vm for your input re Sykt Fuji & Sheng Auto. Before I go to either of them, any recommendations for sg ac gods? My reasoning is if the cost is not prohibitive, I probably will do it here in sg. I don't have much time to go JB but if can really save some $, bo pian then. 

If I go JB & do it there, where to change Rgt? Nearby hopefully. Hardly go JB so really sua ku. Thanks in advance!",27-12-18
"If time is a concern, then any money changer that is convenient for you. At most worse off by a few RM per S$100. For some of us who go in more regularly, we stand to lose tens of RM each time, so it works out to be quite a bit over time.



If you want, just a few pages back there's on in Woodlands or Yishun. You can go there for a first opinion. If a major part is faulty then make arrangements to get it done in JB because you will likely save a fair bit in JB.



If Ubi is a convenient area for you, try checking out L & Kim Car Air-Conditioning, a shop that I have frequented for my past few cars.",27-12-18

He will help you save cost if really no need to change he will ask to you till spoil then find him.

Yeah, the above is the correct long lasting way to re-condition head lamps.  SG is damn ex. guess is the amount of labour needed.  



There is one at KL that does that. YS Head Lamp Recondition Services...  



In JB, i haven come across workshop that dismantle the whole lamp into pieces, most is either polish the outer or/and just take out from your car. 



Those that just polish outside type that cost $50, wont last long.

This is one of the reasons nearly all jb workshops allow people to bring their own parts. They've had a fake parts scourge for quite some time. Even reputed shops kenna cos some workers/temps will steal the genuine part from the shop and replace with a fake one then they go sell the real one and some customer of the shop gets the fake. 



Worst I heard(unverified plus hazy memory) was a woman bought a bag from a designer label in KLCC, either Gucci or Prada or LV,  she was overseas in another country, maybe France or US, in the store of the same label carrying the bag and was approached by staff who told her the bag was fake and she told them she got it from the label shop in KL. They told her they could prove it but would need to destroy the bag, so they cut it open in front of her and inside becomes quite apparent it's not real  they gave her a genuine replacement, of course. Someone in KL had made a nice bonus

Yeh, it's the typical chop carrot shop modus operandi..they see SG plate or number etc and they mark down what it costs to do it in SG by 10-20% and quote. So many people in SG first time doing work there and some even repeat will think the 10-20% is a good enough deal/savings. If ah yuan can do will be really good. Can see  what the job really costs there. 



My own car previous owner got quote of rm300 labour to do some work, I got ah yuan to do was rm150. SG was $150 or so.",19-12-18

Tie rods are one of part of the steering system at the under-carriage.. Look also lower control arms too. The ""cok cok"" noise when turning and or down a road hump may be caused by the worn our rubber bushing in these control arms. Some control arms allow bushing change while others do not allow.",09-12-18

This brand and model is rare in Malaysia, at least i dun see that many on the roads around JB. 

Looks like you know what are the parts needed for 160k major servicing. Suggest you buy parts in sg and bring in JB. 

There are few shops that do this brand. Refer to the list done by one of the bro here. back a few pages in this thread.



Good luck",05-12-18

AFAIK malaysia taxes imported goods quite heavily which is why their imported cars also are really expensive compared to countries like Aus and US. I imagine the same for imported parts..unless they have some OEM makers there and you're ok with non-genuine parts like for few years COE left type. Ideal would be for you to get the part you need from local stockist in SG and bring to JB workshop for the labour. 



If I were you, I'd make a note of any funny sounds, vibrations, anything out of the ordinary and bring it to a reliable workshop like CarClick Garage or TS Motor and let them test drive/troubleshoot then based on what they recommend to change or do, plus the 160K major service recommendations on part changes one shot go and buy all the parts and do.



Don't bring in new parts into JB too openly though, use the green channel(far left, far right after passport check counter) to clear and keep the parts in plastic bag with water bottles/rags etc or in an inconspicuous place.",05-12-18

Ah..to compare like that, I don't know man.. Based on my research last time, the grades Dot 3, Dot 4, Dot 4+, highest(4+) is backwards compatible except for Dot 5.1 which is silicone based I think. It's a difference in boiling points, 4 and 4+ boil at higher temp. There's also some difference between the brands of how much water the fluid absorbs from air or something which affects its change interval and the viscosity..this was some time ago..memory a bit hazy  



The Brembo one all this I've heard is primarily for performance applications such as BMW M Series vehicles or track cars where the braking system is under immense stress.

Hmm I never use silicone spray before bro. Normally all these squeaks, WD40 does the trick, just have a rag, spray, open and close the door a few times so it gets into the hinge nicely, wipe wipe wipe, spray, door close and open, wipe wipe wipe. Should be good to go, if you want can spray and wipe the extra off for a finishing touch also.



The Singer machine oil never help? Probably dirt and grime which WD40 and a rag will get out.

Edit: was reading about silicone lubricant, seems used in treadmills etc. and can be hard to remove..hope you didn't spray too much..if the WD40 doesn't work may need to get a solvent to wipe/scrub the treated area down then repeat the WD40 process.

Oh, sorry, you're looking for used pair? Not sure if LCH carry that but can try asking. Can also ask the others, sometimes got trade in pair. Down to luck...can also check Carousell. I had surveyed the JB shops for new tyre price recently. 17"" still cheaper here but LCH was quite close..







 This is what I recently checked the shops for..SG still cheaper but LCH offered me the best price for JB for 17"" PS4..

Normally alignment is chargeable bro, even JB also but there cheaper to do. Tyres usually come with free fitting and balancing.

You can check CarClick, Hawk Tayar, LCH, LCH Bros. Best if you already know what you want then just get quotes. JB good thing is alignment and balancing is cheap. PM me if you want to cross check some SG stores for prices also, I need to dig it up but I have a few good places listed somewhere..

 bro must just actively source la..on and off different places will have. I've gotten from numerous sources..online direct seller, some people upsize rims then stock tyres quite new can get good deal they want to clear for a bit more than the shop offer them trade in, most people will just trade in to save the hassle though. Got those that don't like the tyre cos too noisy etc then sell near new also, I don't care about road noise, got traction can liao.  One rim workshop also last time someone had just traded the tyres in, I came in before they even needed to put into their system advertise all that and got a pretty good fast deal price. Sometimes can only get 2pcs of the same kind, some people fussy want all 4 the same, I'm fine with matching tread on one axle.

Yeh, normally shouldn't..I've only seen it happen on cars around 20yrs plus old or if a set of rims has been stored for a long time in less than ideal conditions like in the sun etc. Dry climate it happens more because the valve stem dries out/hardens and starts cracking.

Thanks for the share  Yup, all cheap things must proceed with caution. So many things have fakes now. As long as their price to manufacture is low and they can markup enough to sell cheap and fast since the product always got demand, worth to do. 



I actually bought the Toyota WS ATF from that seller.. Very cheap also, $35 for the tin. It was genuine.  If/when I buy the drum shell from him I'll put a bit into a clear container and take a comparison shot with a bottle of verified genuine shell that I had gotten from Giant here. If it doesn't exactly match got funny business liao. 



Oh, the video that guy the starting part advice was going OK to educate people on fake sellers on the Internet etc. Then suddenly he said should buy from Shell petrol station. Hahaha. The price also he said rm250 plus. Their Giant selling rm85 but imported one made in EU. He promoting the locally available one. Someone asked him if it was an advert.  He said yes, Shell is driving the message, can read the video description. He wrote there.

"Tried Idemitsu once for my previous car. So so only. I didn't think there's a difference from SHU. But back in the day, the Royal Purple I got online (when Amazon shipping was free) was better than the Idemitsu.

			RM200 for wax and polish? Wah that's the same price as that Legends car wash at B.Point. I guess the BTS 400rm will have some degree of same colour touch up so end result would be better. When a car's shiny the smallest imperfections become more apparent.

I just dropped by BTS, asked for quote for touch up whole car is rm2700 and polish is rm400. My car does have a number of small marks etc considering its 9yrs old on stock paint.

For older cars that just want a spruce up or don't care so much about small stone dents etc I'll probably go for a cheaper option. I saw a sg Audi there. A same colour exterior respray may be good enough.

Yeh, I was thinking that too but those S$900-$1400 exterior respray some places offer I guess doesn't include correction of all the small small dents? That's more for cars exposed to a lot of sun and bird **** that wears off the clear coat and starts eating the paint while the body is actually still in decent condition. I imagine an OPC car that's parked all day in the sun and hardly driven would be good choice for that. Also, the cheapest respray is for small cars like Aveo, Fit, swift etc. 

My car not that small  



I'm going to bring my car to a sg shop that handles quite attas cars and exotics to get a quote also.

 imho rm380 isn't cheap leh. That's S$120.... for polishing only? Supercar, maybe la, still expensive lol 



Professional groomers in sg like Ace Gt charge $140.00 â€“ $218.00 depending on the car for polish & wax.

https://www.thebestsingapore.com/best-service/ace-gt/

And as a note, if the price of something in msia is anywhere near that of sg shops, it's a carrot situation in my book. This of course doesn't apply if you go and google ""most expensive/attas car spray paint shop in malaysia"" and get prices from them. There are definitely insanely over the top priced ones there also that cater to a select crowd and may not even service all prospective customers. Our Crown Prince of Johor needs a place to have his LaFerrari  and many many other toys kept shiny. 



This is the price board of the B.Point car wash(after the Petronas&Shell stations). Polishing alone using Auto Glym product for regular cars is rm120, polish & wax at rm200.",16-11-18

Last time by my civic radiator fan died I went LCH bros and ah hong was the one who help me diagnose, get the replacement part, take it apart and all that. He was ok with me leh, like reasonably friendly, talk cock all cos it took a while for the part to come. Maybe he got on and off days type or I dunno haha..I never really see him xia lan..



That's one of the biggest turn offs for me, more than try to hard sell etc. is show attitude. No way to do business. There needs to be a basic amicable service standard and that respect should be reciprocated by the customer. No one's doing anyone any favours. One gets money, one gets service.",16-11-18

Yeh, there are definitely numerous tiers for panel beating and spray work. In countries like Aus where labour is ridiculously expensive and the more skilled they are the more they charge, you can really see a crazy range which is reflective of the quality of the job done. Can be as cheap as $2-3K and as expensive as $8-10K or even more if you want special **** and everything else in between. Count by no. of hours of work done, prep is a very large part and cheaper jobs prep will also be short so finish product not as good.



That said, if they're charging prices almost comparable to the average SG spray shop, their quality better be comparable to the top notch shops in SG. I'll need to suss them out myself. Will do it soon.",16-11-18

This is the price board of the B.Point car wash(after the Petronas&Shell stations). Polishing alone using Auto Glym product for regular cars is rm120, polish & wax at rm200.

			Hi guys I bought a second hand car abt 2 and a half months ago and now Iâ€™m having some trouble with it. According to the mechanic who they asked me to go to keep the warranty he said that my cars piston lining is gone and we have to overhaul the enegine. And I asked the dealer wether it can be done and he replied me saying that itâ€™s only for gear box that he gave warrenty but then I remember him telling me so clearly that enegine is included too. According to the black and white itâ€™s not stated that he cannot do the engine but he is trying to make me bare the cost. I only got this car for 2months plus and Iâ€™m afraid I will lose out in this matter. Pls advise me on this and thank you so much

I went to one shop at Austin for car wash. I also went to Dlux.. Dlux more like those houses converted into a shop. 



I went Dlux for wax and wash was not bad.. when I return for my car I still see wet parts near the boot area and some parts, not properly dried. But to be fair I was not there to witness the washing as I went for my breakfast.



I prefer the one at Austin while looking at how much effort they took. They really wipe every part of the exterior dry. Not only they vacuum the interior they also wipe. 14RM.

But if you wan do coating not recommended.. seems like they see SG car quote higher price.

Bukit Indah, where I later went, was much better. Plenty of eateries around while I wait for my car to get serviced. RM20 for labour towards EO change. RM10 for a car wash. Spent RM30 today on my car and pumped some cheap petrol on the way back. Splendid.

			think toyota most workshop are quite experienced with it esp for old cars' wear & tear

i would suggest go to a workshop u r comfortable with and see what needs to be change n come back buy the parts n bring over again



COE-renewed car probably can expect engine mountings worn...all the belts depending on mileage n previous owner change or not..i would personally change all oil/fluid..check yr brakes to check it life...tyres depending on size - bigger sizes SG is cheaper



the rest like shocks, bearings & bushing maybe can wait for symptoms to appear...



some mechanics, i believe ah yuan is like this too, wont recommend u to change internals of engine if u r thinking of doing overhaul or something unless again u get the symptoms like engine eating oil or loss of compression or engine knocking...think modern days engine are quite well built now and and shld last with proper maintenance



im looking for a decent dashboard n door restoration also...lemme know if u have yr done

			Toyota nothing to worry unless it's one of those super RARE models like ISIS or sienta. Even if it's a rare model the only downside is that most of the spare parts will be from Japan (more exp)



In Bolehland, most car owners don't visit the workshop unless their car got something spoilt else they only do normal servicing. So bolehland workshops won't ask you to change this/that unless you tell them there is a problem.



Dashboard = check with BTS spray paint

Workshop = Carclick or any Hawk Tayar

			Servicing due? Have it checked all round during servicing. Carclick's pricing is mostly reasonable, workmanship is good and fast. You can go there if you want to do up some wear and tear for COE renewal.



Alternatively, you can do a one-time servicing in SG; there are reasonably priced ones starting from $50. Go through those FOC 15/20/30/40 points check and also inform them you are going to renew COE and wants to know which wear & tear to replace (but don't tell them that you're going other workshop to do lah ).



BUT rmb, you're not obliged to change those parts unless it's super critical (e.g. your belt is torn halfway, low on coolant but you don't need a flush perhaps a topup, etc). Some might sell or hard sell.



As for melted dashboard, try to find 2nd hand parts scrapyard.

			For all the mechanical checks... ie: gear box, engine and related, go to Carclick. 

Agreed, better you try one round servicing at sg, get them check and tell you what is due to change/ issues, then get all the parts needed and fix it at JB.



For accessories and car a/c, you can try Sheng Auto.

Either you can try Carlick, which is popular in this thread, or else you can try:



L10 Pro

23, Jalan Permas 9/9, Bandar Permas Jaya, 81750 Masai, Johor.

Contact Ah Chen @ +6012-794 2588.



Vibrating can be many causes. Probably need longer time for trouble shooting.



Have you asked in BMW chat group if any?



Please take note: As is a row type workshops, expect workshop conditions like those in Sin Ming Industrial Estate.

Brake Pad x 2 - 280 rm

Second hand Ballast 1 side - 380 rm

Ballast is considered as a very rare item in Bolehland. 

Sg also cut throat pricing - your SGD$80 is dirt cheap.

"Yup. Ballast was quite exp. But didn't wanna waste time go find somewhere else for it. Somemore secondhand salvaged from other cars.

As for payment. He actually brought me to bank to draw money from ATM &#55357; coz I didn't bring enough cash(sgd included)

"Hi All,



Recently just took over my friend's car (Toyota) and going to extend COE. From the compile list of workshop, I notice there a workshop specialist for Toyota.



I intend to have the whole car check to see any wear and tear to change afterall this car have been driven for 10yrs.



Should I go directly to the Toyota specialist or Ah Sheng or CarClick? Since the both of them have good review here. Or I should just get it check in SG?

Iâ€™m going in tmr. Going back to LCH to see howâ€™s the service now.,11-11-18
i think im going to fuji sometime this wk. 2 aircon pipe leaking =[,11-11-18
"think toyota most workshop are quite experienced with it esp for old cars' wear & tear

i would suggest go to a workshop u r comfortable with and see what needs to be change n come back buy the parts n bring over again



COE-renewed car probably can expect engine mountings worn...all the belts depending on mileage n previous owner change or not..i would personally change all oil/fluid..check yr brakes to check it life...tyres depending on size - bigger sizes SG is cheaper



the rest like shocks, bearings & bushing maybe can wait for symptoms to appear...



some mechanics, i believe ah yuan is like this too, wont recommend u to change internals of engine if u r thinking of doing overhaul or something unless again u get the symptoms like engine eating oil or loss of compression or engine knocking...think modern days engine are quite well built now and and shld last with proper maintenance



im looking for a decent dashboard n door restoration also...lemme know if u have yr done

			Hi All,



Recently just took over my friend's car (Toyota) and going to extend COE. From the compile list of workshop, I notice there a workshop specialist for Toyota.



I intend to have the whole car check to see any wear and tear to change afterall this car have been driven for 10yrs.



Should I go directly to the Toyota specialist or Ah Sheng or CarClick? Since the both of them have good review here. Or I should just get it check in SG?



And also any recommendation for dashboard restoration in JB as my dashboard melted under long hour parking under the open space car park.



Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks All!

Toyota nothing to worry unless it's one of those super RARE models like ISIS or sienta. Even if it's a rare model the only downside is that most of the spare parts will be from Japan (more exp)



In Bolehland, most car owners don't visit the workshop unless their car got something spoilt else they only do normal servicing. So bolehland workshops won't ask you to change this/that unless you tell them there is a problem.



Dashboard = check with BTS spray paint

Workshop = Carclick or any Hawk Tayar

Servicing due? Have it checked all round during servicing. Carclick's pricing is mostly reasonable, workmanship is good and fast. You can go there if you want to do up some wear and tear for COE renewal.



Alternatively, you can do a one-time servicing in SG; there are reasonably priced ones starting from $50. Go through those FOC 15/20/30/40 points check and also inform them you are going to renew COE and wants to know which wear & tear to replace (but don't tell them that you're going other workshop to do lah ).



BUT rmb, you're not obliged to change those parts unless it's super critical (e.g. your belt is torn halfway, low on coolant but you don't need a flush perhaps a topup, etc). Some might sell or hard sell.



As for melted dashboard, try to find 2nd hand parts scrapyard.",12-11-18

For all the mechanical checks... ie: gear box, engine and related, go to Carclick. 

Agreed, better you try one round servicing at sg, get them check and tell you what is due to change/ issues, then get all the parts needed and fix it at JB.



For accessories and car a/c, you can try Sheng Auto.",12-11-18

hmm from the videos i see, there is no sensor for anything external of the car. internal yes, will not clamp down on people/items/applied force.

Interior LED Lights. 

Pros, can see everything! No more darkness! 

Cons, you can finally see the cockroach that is running around & will kenna call ah beng chia.



Actually this one can DIY na, just get those cigarette port ones from Lazada/Shopee/Taobao/etc and turn on when u need.



Door Handle Lights.

Pros, additional lights maybe chio.

Cons, you can finally see the scratches behind the handle clearly at night & also kenna stop by LTA.",08-11-18

Many mechanics in malaysia got the can do attitude so they'll try to do it but it's best to ask them to do the work they're specialised in.

			My most recent is install reverse LED light and the led strip x 2 install inside my boot. Labour is 30RM. Time taken 10-25mins. As the guy need to cut wire and link to rear boot light. 



They clean the surface forst before sticking teh led strip then use proper tape to hide the wires. 



Now I open boot very bright led lights.

Not worth to buy JB workshop oil and oil filter(actually the filter depends, some workshops can get for very competitive price but oil is nearly always ex). Can get cheaper in SG. Cheapest option is to get the Carousell seller oil $20 for 4L Shell Helix 5W40 or sometimes the Tesco in JB got promo for eo if you're not comfortable with drum oil.  Get the oil filter from SG stockist should be about $10. Then send to Ah Yuan or TS Motor or one of the other recommended workshops just for their labour which is very little. 



Cheapest option in SG is go to the Fave app and find the servicing voucher. Can get for $28-$38 with oil and filter included(can hunt promo code also, cheapest servicing I paid for is $18 after codes). They have a clause that can only use the voucher once per car so either hop to different workshop or can try your luck to see if they allow repeat visit. If cannot, let me know, I buy the voucher from you for what you paid.

Different car require different amount. Check your manual or best is ask mechanic check after eo change just ensure don't overflow engine oil

Can liao.

Engine flush got people sell one set 40 dollars 

Brand is liquid moley



Search engine flush in caroseull bro. 



Coolant just go lynlex buy Toyota super coolant 

2 bottles about 6 litre plus can flush and topup 



Each bottle about 23 dollars. 



Brake pads just change normal can liao like bendix or fujiace. 

Rotors wait then change if got sound. 



Can try go the below brake stockist buy. 

Inwah Pte ltd.

Bendix front , rear use n brake can liao. 

Front more important 





For rotor can buy at below

Personally, this price is reasonable. 

Check system, pump out new old gas and recharge new gas with oil, i do it annually. Change dryer when checking the system during annual check.

Avante.



 Total 2hrs job but about 1hr is waiting for delivery. My job takes 3 times delivery (compressor, condenser and filter) because he only decided to change the specific parts halfway through.



I never ask for discount because i think recon compressor in sgp already S$400+ (his brand new only S$500)

Condensor he say cost price about RM$300 so he didn't charge me more (think he feel paisay that he ask me to change partly he also want to change for easier job)



He didn't chat with me much. Keep seeing him walking around finding menial things to do. Think now got apprentice liao his job just to oversee so he not used to doing nothing.

He could be already pouring a second bottle to top up a bit.

4 litres is standard - with oil filter could be 0.1 to 0.3 litres more.

"2: AudioLution Car Accessories



334, Jalan Dato Sulaiman, Taman Abad, 80250 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia



After late lunch, went to Audioliton to do soundproof as made appt thru FB at 530PM. Location alongthe famous stretch of KSL.



parked my car in, saw no car at all..abit worry as knife will be sharp for SG cars..



the boss came..a bit fat guy inside the peekture.. plus 3 workers inside..told him contacted thru FB to do soundproof on door using 3M material 2 layer for 3 doors at 388RM



then he look at car and door then say worry my car abit hard to do..

then told him all car same what..then he say some car like masda he do before hard to do..



then proceed to say try ask me take better material then 3M which cost 500RM. then I told him actually i don't need better material as my issue is rattling on the front pax door issues..





then he said, he not trying to hard sell me anything but say he want me take better material cos want assure do liao no more rattling blah blah..



then i proposed to him say ok all door 3M 2 layer but the front pax door one layer 3M one layer better material.. then he say okay la like that also can..

then i ask him how much la.. then he pause for seconds..



inside my heart thinking must be dunno price what anyhow chop..

then open mouth say 450RM give me..say just another 20SGD which in sg eat one meal finish liao





I say okay..450RM do it..then I took out LED strip and reverse bulb and car plate bulb..ask him can install anot..he look at it say can..I say how much



he say kopi money 30RM can liao.



I say okay..total spent 480RM.



so he told his worker to do it as price say liao



worker A start to do my door..dismantle all panel..



worker B do bulbs and led strip.



both worker very friendly as I talk to them while waiting..



was there 1st hour then took my car key went to KSL walk walk as fist time at this shop,abit worry.



came back saw the worker A finish one door only.



worker B done up car boot light swee swee with add on of wiring.

reverse light also good.





stand there waiting and observe worker A do work..very slowly and carefully with no hurry.. talk to him more when he was doing my last door which is the pax door..ensure then one layer 3M one layer better material..



came a few more SG cars doing light and window tint.





once done,test all my door if working well anot and make sure window all okay.paid the fat boss 480 RM and left a happy man



the fat boss still asked me: brother swee bo? as he saw me testing all door.

LOL



overall this shop I feel the labour work is nicely done up with no rush and the workers know what they are doing.



but just be-careful of the boos trying to hard sell..

overall if compare price..if here is cheaper will come here do accessories again.



today drove my car totally solve the issues liao and door also heavier now.

the sound now when driving totally different liao compare to before.



450RM = 150SGD sound proof 2 layer with proper installation where to find in SG???",15-10-18

Inform your frd to explore further away from KSL and he/she will know the difference more than just having pick up/ drop off services provided by those wkshp near KSL.

Cross check with other JB workshops on that material for sound proof. Prices usually comes with what materials used. 



Autofun and dratex materials for each application ...ie sound proofing or for vibration absorb at its best. These two brands are popular. SG workshop also uses these two brands commonly. Another brand- Dr Silent. 



Search for AudioLution in FB, 4 doors, 2 layers each door all in at RM388. Using 3M material. You gauge yourself and check if this promo still on.



Windscreen, check with your car  insurance coverage dent/chip off can claim or not.

Tesco always have special offer for EO roughly every 1.5-2.5 mths. I just humtum 2-3 bots. RM79 for a w30 is a steal, morever it's a reputable Malaysian brand.

"At hawk tayar now. Quoted brake pads for a pair for $160rm, made in Malaysia.



Asked to clean throttle body and he ask if there was anything wrong with my engine? Else no point cleaning.





In my opinion, can only find them for tyres..



I asked for brake pad and they only have this brand susuka which I am not comfortable to change to. Anyone can intro where to change for a reliable brand?

Good price for the pads. Else you may want to go buy pads at local parts shops.



Throttle body cleaning has yet to picked up in JB. Need some time for those workshop to equipped with it as most request comes from sg owners.

Similar to back then EO additives.



Probably because cars in sg are the most expensive thus all these extra stuffs can be accepted by sg car owners.

Got some doubts on how effective those fuel cleaners cos you can't physically see it~

Don't think pump until 300kpa then release, 300kpa is a lot and need to hold on to the nozzle for quite some time to reach 300kpa.

I have friends who own workshops and also been to many different workshops, this is a very common tactic to gain your trust. So cannot rule out the possibility.

Accessories you go to accessories shops like Sheng auto.



Anything to do with engine, gearbox, suspension you go to workshop like lch, CBU, hawk tayar.etc 

In JB you need to tell the mechanic to do a overall check eg you need to go for long distance travel, car inspection.etc

			So I went to Jet troubleshoot the sounds, and he confirmed that it's my steering rack and absorber links that are not in good condition. I didn't commit to repairs on the spot, and he didn't attempt to make me commit. I like that, and will be returning to him in future for non-basic stuff that can't be done at LCH.



Also went to Sheng Auto, and initially wanted to install a pair of fog lamps and replace the head unit (which somehow didn't work when at Da Sen previously). Jackson said the old headunit wasn't wired properly, even though it was functional. So I'm now a little more skeptical about Da Sen, unfortunately.

The specialist who was supposed to install my fog lamps was thorough and told me that the right side of the bumper was glued to the body's frame and couldn't be dismantled without risking a bigger crack/damage to the bumper, likely due to a past accident and the repair shop simply took the easy way out to make it look ok cosmetically. So, in the end I didn't install the fog lamps as I didn't want to drive around with a damaged bumper, and will do it next time when I'm there earlier and include time to visit a spray paint shop to touch up if necessary. Very professional on their end, and didn't ""do first talk later"".

being been to both places 

Sheng Auto & Da Sen



these are my impression



1) Da Sen 

staffs are quite new, only the å¤´æ‰‹ not bad, the rest do things need to ask the boss one. good thing is lesser cars, more staffs, means you do not need to wait long



2) Sheng Auto

lack of staffs, go in the morning can wait until at night then collect car. 

the staffs there skinner one golden hair, also once didnt wired my car legroom lights wire, drive back to SG no lights. go back to Jackson, he say ""è¯¥éª‚çš„...(referring to that staff that connect my wires)





price wise, Da Sen is cheaper for labor, but if you need to buy from them and install, I think Jackson Sheng Auto still cheaper overall",23-07-18

Toyota parts can always call Transglober and find out the price.

Especially if the spare parts have to import from Japan, sg might be cheaper.

			Normal lah the tireman, used to it liao. I just take it that he's being upfront loh. Usually I'll just approach Ah Yuan or the short spec guy (Ah hong is it?) if it's more technical. 



Every workshop have different competency level and what they are good or not so good at. If they can't do AC well then I won't let them do my AC definitely.



I think more importantly is to get your issue resolved. Cheap and good don't go together. Workmanship good can already, it's fine if service is not there and it's a bonus if they are fast, which I feel that LCH bros is always fast.



I also sometimes feel that I'm quite troublesome leh, they check no issue but I kept insisting got issue  I just want to get my issues resolved lah. If they can diagnose and fix the issue then good loh, cannot then I'll just go elsewhere.

I went to LCH brothers for the first time recently to do wheel alignment (RM35) and tighten my handbrake (RM30). 



Thought their attitude was so-so only. Wheel alignment was pretty okay but the handbrake was over-tightened by their young staffs (the boss-like guy, whom I assume is Ah yuan was just popping by occasionally to check). 



Ended up that once I left the shop and drove over a patch of rough roads, my car shook so violently that initially I thought I blew a gasket or timing belt. Suspecting that it was a jammed brake, I went back to LCH to rectify. Another more senior dude came to check and was a little defensive - like how could a tightened handbrake cause violent shaking. Anw we got it loosened again and the car was good to go.   



Are they really the cheapest? How about Hawk taya and the other LCH shop? If they are the cheapest then I have no complains",10-07-18

Normal lah the tireman, used to it liao. I just take it that he's being upfront loh. Usually I'll just approach Ah Yuan or the short spec guy (Ah hong is it?) if it's more technical. 



Every workshop have different competency level and what they are good or not so good at. If they can't do AC well then I won't let them do my AC definitely.



I think more importantly is to get your issue resolved. Cheap and good don't go together. Workmanship good can already, it's fine if service is not there and it's a bonus if they are fast, which I feel that LCH bros is always fast.



I also sometimes feel that I'm quite troublesome leh, they check no issue but I kept insisting got issue  I just want to get my issues resolved lah. If they can diagnose and fix the issue then good loh, cannot then I'll just go elsewhere.",10-07-18

And again usually for detecting sound, it is quite a ""painful journey"" for everyone as the mechanic need to may need try a few things before getting it right or not.

Yeah, agree with regards to cost. Mechanic/workshop might not want to waste so much time on non-revenue generating troubleshooting, while I wouldn't want to anyhow change parts ""to try"". Want a place willing to spend more time checking each possible location and hopefully hit jackpot.

I was once advised to always check out any odd sound that shouldn't be there, because it means something is not right. And until you know exactly what causes it, you can't be sure of the implications it may cause.

"Anyway, I went to LCH Brothers yesterday to ask Ah Yuan to check out a very annoying creaking sound I get occasionally when crossing speed reducing strips, or bumpy roads, or sometimes even when driving on relatively smooth roads. He inspected and said should be my rear shocks, which were then replaced for RM600 and 1 hour+++. After driving off, the sound was still present... turned round again and got them to check again, and this time he and another mechanic said should be coming from the front, which upon more careful analysing, I concurred. So now it's a ""small"" matter of changing the steering rack to a scrap car one (knocking sound when turning the steering wheel quickly), for about RM1000, or the front shocks. Ah Yuan said that the front shocks looked ok to him, but I have this sneaky suspicion it's that.",02-07-18

good or not subject to your ear. I feel its good enough for me, as i have a bad encounter at SG, and i feel they tune much better then the SG 1..



There might be better tuning out there.. but price wise much better at there.



Soundproof all they do, they always have some funny brand speaker but sound wise i will say quite good as i listen to their demo set before..



To add on they have some funny brand DSP which cost a fraction of the branded one in SG yet can do same function or better.

Guess these camber nuts are adjustable and make adjustment easier for the mechanics during alignment.

"So I went to 2 of the places mentioned here.



1st Stop: Da Sen Audio

Brought my own remote alarm system, and a headunit, both bought from TaoBao.

My Stream doesn't have an existing remote alarm/unlock system, was charged RM150.

For the headunit they charged RM80, but after dismantling and hooking up the new headunit, found that it doesn't power on, so had to undo everything and put back the old headunit. So now I have a headunit that doesn't power on and needs to be sent back to the seller in CN.

Also enquired, and they quoted RM1199 for an Android headunit, speakers (didn't ask any details on which brand) and reverse cam (which I already have). Is that reasonable? Or might I get a better deal somewhere else?



2nd Stop: R&R Auto Detailer

Did a standard Wash & Wax at RM188, and did the headlight restoration at RM88. Walked to AEON Bukit Indah and whiled 3 hours there before walking back to collect the car. Headlights now look pretty good, will share photo of the headlights if anyone else is interested - downside is I don't have a comparable shot of ""before"". But the wax layer don't seem very solid - maybe because this car's paintwork is old and rough in the first place.

Was at Paradigm before that, and the polishing centre in the basement carpark quoted something like RM465 for a full service, something about 2 layers of wax and windscreen treatment, but they don't do headlights. I know there's also one in Sutera Mall, but I didn't enquire about pricing there. Not sure if any of them would be better.



Will probably be going in one more time to replace my headunit, since the one in the car is quite old and the touchscreen no longer functions after being re-installed after the failed replacement. Really want to be able to use Google Maps on the headunit.",18-06-18

			Basic servicing maybe should just do in Singapore, for my case, i engaged Jet after visiting 3 different workshops in SG to settle my suspension + shock absorber + engine mount problems which still exists until I went to his shop at Tun Aminah.



I would say his troubleshooting skills are on the expert level and he will test drive around after every fix he did ( which I don't see any workshops in SG do....., at least from my own experience) 



Price wise he's still cheaper to what SG workshops quoted me (30% less) with new parts rather than 2nd hand parts in SG....

I went there to install the pioneer AVH-8850BT. At the same time i brought my horns to install. They installed the horns for me FOC. Need to remove bumper. Usually this kind, they will charge labour. But they did it for me FOC and i didn't even ask for this to be done free. Can add this shop to the list.

			Basic servicing maybe should just do in Singapore, for my case, i engaged Jet after visiting 3 different workshops in SG to settle my suspension + shock absorber + engine mount problems which still exists until I went to his shop at Tun Aminah.



I would say his troubleshooting skills are on the expert level and he will test drive around after every fix he did ( which I don't see any workshops in SG do....., at least from my own experience) 



Price wise he's still cheaper to what SG workshops quoted me (30% less) with new parts rather than 2nd hand parts in SG....



Basic servicing I will just go to shell or SPC service stations for a quickie lol

Its never wise to top up aircon gas. Boss at Fuji car cooler will also not recommend that. Its most likely you are having a leak somewhere in the system or you just need a servicing.

Settled suspension issue at TS Motor. Xiao Ming is definitely much more approachable and friendly to talk to. Took Grab to Paradigm to shop while he settled my car. He sent photos of damaged parts to me while I was shopping so I can make a decision whether to replace some parts or not. 



His workshop is small though, but luckily I was first to arrive. Canâ€™t tell about workmanship/skills yet as my problem was quite straightforward.

Very reasonable prices and they know their stuff. Trustworthy and honest shop. If you go, can tell them the Singapore black civic guy that used to go to them recommend you. My car scrap liao.

What happened? Care to share your experience bro?

My personal alternate for LCH Bros is this shop called TS Motor Workshop Services

58, Jalan Setia Tropika 1/7, Taman Setia Tropika , 81200 Johor Bahru, Johor

+60 16-762 3240

+60 12 465 1618 (Xiao Ming, ex-BMS mechanic)



Very reasonable prices and they know their stuff. Trustworthy and honest shop. If you go, can tell them the Singapore black civic guy that used to go to them recommend you. My car scrap liao.

Anyway when they checked they never take out much thing

What I observe is they will drive your car one round then come back and will advise what to change 



You as the driver will know roughly which parts wear off liao. 



Like for me change front and rear absorber recently. 

Never ask them check just change. 

Stopper also change 

Front mounting also change 

Lower arm with ball joint also change 



So for your car when u drive u should know the problem then just change it since u will drive it for peace of mind",06-05-18

My boleh land car uses a TYT engine. When i bgt coolant from JB shop, they ask me what coolant colour using currently in my car. 

They say, just dun mix coolants with diff colours. I asked why leh? shop says, for my car, have RED AND Green colour. Therefore if mix, colour will turn to brownish. Then next servicing, mechanics may say rust in your cooling system.

Since we cant see it, why waste time and money keep restoring it? =/

Leak doesnt mean u need to recon the whole. 



Try this first. Remove the old gasket n put on a new one, change tranny filter n then put in new tranny fluid. 



Should be less than sgd200 if u do it in sg. Bring ur own filter gasket n oil to lch will save u some money too.

Just go bts paintshop or whatsapp him first. 

Think he will ask the repair bumper guy to come 



Depends how serious the most they will try to push it back then put a strong glue if not remove everything then glue back more. 



Sensor just go accessrroris shop repair or replace with 3rd party

Most likely wire damage or sensor itself



Car plate jb a lot 

Cheap and fast. 



Bumper glue back should be less then 100 rm

I did mine rear side before they help push it back and glue back.

"Visited a few car wash, i realise i still prefer to go back to Supwash. 1 of the main reason other than being able to relac inside their waiting room with air con and wifi, i noticed most RM10 car wash not that detailed.



What i like is after wash, they will dry your car using that vacuum thing to ensure the car is really dry then they will wipe down 1 more time. For your windscreen, they will use another separate cloth to wipe. I think this one is to prevent those small fur sticking onto the windscreen. Vacuum interior is really vacuum everything. What i'm a little impressed about is they really remove everything and vacuum. My boot inside got 1 box of heavy washing equipment(which i don't use, Lol) and pails, they will remove to vacuum and put it back.



Those RM10 washes, only vacuum the car mat area. Not promoting for them but RM17, i feel worth it. Only draw back is they close at 10pm.",18-04-18

			Stock filter or K&N filter is just a filter in the airbox which filters out dusts, leaves, bugs and anything other than air. Think of K&N as a better filter that filters well and allow better airflow which will improve your pickup (slightly-moderately-noticeably but again, it's subjective).



If you want stability at corners, you can lower your ride height (see that big gap between your tyres and wheel fender? close up that gap). To do this, you can either go with lowering springs or coilovers. This will be very effective vs strut bars.



Another way to ""feel more stable"" is to change out those 14 or 15"" 5.5jj width stock rims for 15 or 16"" 6.5jj aftermarket rims (for vios).



Strut bar? Do it after all the above is achieved if you still feel that it's not enough.

Ya once in a while I will take a close look at them.

The rotors I bought are considered Branded in China, they are not cheap in China.

It's a very different biz culture compare to sg

Don't bargain. Either you accept the price or go elsewhere.



Workshop biz is very competitive in Johor, just drive around 1 area of shophouses you can spot no less than 3 workshops. It's kinda saturated.



Workshop owners knows what's the market rate and quote you the lowest price possible. By bargaining, they will see you as being difficult although will still do your biz but don't expect anything extra and they will not do anything more to retain lousy customers.

Rotors n brake pads non mechanical as in no moving parts inside. It's just a piece of round shape alloy so I am ok with it. Already using close to a year. Ceramic Brake pads I bought mid range type, so so but can do the job. Strut bars they copied Cusco and the quality is as good as Cusco.



I will be getting ""higher end"" brake pads in the coming months.

Yap, i would prefer not to bargain too as I'm not used to it. Fully agree that workshop is ultimately a business and as long as the price is fair we should let them earn.

Many people here all Been there done that. It's just more air flow, own self feel very powerful until you see another car makes you smell their smoke bcos they got a bigger engine than yours. The only real powerful upgrade is to swap a bigger engine.

Stock filter or K&N filter is just a filter in the airbox which filters out dusts, leaves, bugs and anything other than air. Think of K&N as a better filter that filters well and allow better airflow which will improve your pickup (slightly-moderately-noticeably but again, it's subjective).



If you want stability at corners, you can lower your ride height (see that big gap between your tyres and wheel fender? close up that gap). To do this, you can either go with lowering springs or coilovers. This will be very effective vs strut bars.



Another way to ""feel more stable"" is to change out those 14 or 15"" 5.5jj width stock rims for 15 or 16"" 6.5jj aftermarket rims (for vios).



Strut bar? Do it after all the above is achieved if you still feel that it's not enough.

short answer, no.

Iâ€™m on a Honda Fit. Reason for changing is because like what you said, the plastic parts tend to crack. Iâ€™m not looking for any engine performance, just donâ€™t want a cracking leaking rad. Reason why I ask if a bigger rad reduces engine performance is because there seems to be a uncertainty about this. Water pump has to work harder to send the same amount of pressure through the fins. I understand about the thermostat part . More or less it has to close the flow for engine to warm up before it opens to allow coolant flowing back to rad for cooling .",10-04-18

Think you have the same problem with hoboonhua. Old Sienta(JDM) is super rare in both sg and Malaysia, there are probably more Lamborghini than Sienta during that era(10yrs ago).



Try Transglober and rictat

Yup. A lot of people just maybe wanna squeeze every drop of juice out of the ringgit but end up becoming a cheapo and loses even more.



Engine oil is the only thing I don't purchase from LCH brothers. All other parts are from them, especially parts that costs RM300+ I didn't even think, it's only SGD100+ and in sg workshops you can't change sh!t with SGD$100+

Let them earn some money.



I can't state here what are the freebies/foc services that were given to me for being a nice customer. Different customers have different ""rewards"" the door swings both ways.

Basically I believe you need to understand that different drivers have different driving patterns. Some drivers brakes more than others, especially those bustards you encounter who keeps braking even though there is no car in front of them.



So the advice to you to change brake pads in next X Months is rather general and not trying to cheat you.

			yeah. only bad point i can think of ah yuan is they should have at least some checklist to check thru some stuff instead of we tell him what to check then he check. sometime got a few issue but really cannot remember all and one shot tell him.



anyone know roughly how much ah yuan charge for tyre rotation?

actually, its quite simple. As car owner, you should roughly know the condition of your car. Got sound, got this, got that, you should know it. Make your own checklist before heading down. I do that so i make sure he covers all my suspicion. To make things simple, everytime i visit them, i will tell them my problem, ask ah yuan to test drive. Test drive is very very important. After he test drive, he will tell you the issue or he will check for you. I think ah yuan also want you to save some money. Don't everything also change. Of course, he can tell you to change everything, but are you ready for it? Those parts that can use a bit longer, he will tell you not to change. Of course, if its worn or unusable anymore, he will advice you to change. And to change or not, he also won't force you. So do you want a mechanic who tells you to change everything, even at the slightest suspicion or wait awhile longer, drive it out and have a more obvious telltale sign before changing? There is a reason why we recommend ah yuan. If you think of it, this is one of it.",04-04-18

Is good to have checklist cos most of sg workshops do that to show the work 

process.... naturally, sg car owners are tuned to this concept.



In Jb, please tune to go along the JB way of getting the repair fixed.",04-04-18

I dont think I have spoken to ah yuan during my past 2 visits. First time was the guy wearing shirt. The 2nd time liaised directly with their mech wearing specs. During my last visit, they didnt issue any receipt to me until i requested for it, thus the hand written one. It was until when I was about to leave when i saw one spore reg veh arriving and requesting for ah yuan. Seems like a quiet guy as all along he was quietly doing his stuff at one corner without much interaction . is he the boss or one of the mech?

Been there 3 times and I noticed they dont really take initiative to check everything to let you know what needs to replace. Normally you need to tell them specifically what to check then they will check. Other than this, their service and price is good",03-04-18

CAI mod for Vios changes the air intake from engine bay (hot air) to outside of engine bay (cool air). K&N filter helps to increase air flow rate.

I found him quite pushy, he had a 30 mins convo with me. I told him 'bro, I came here to do A, so just let me have A done'

If nothing wrong with your car = nothing to change. Just go for a oil change and ask them to check at the same time. In JB they usually mark up a little bit unlike sg workshops they mark up 30% or more for spare parts.



I usually just bring engine oil to LCH brothers, all other parts they supply.

Bts lor. Mine was charged RM 250 for whole bumper with some knocking. If you are just touching up, should not cost more than that.

"Now at LCH. 6 months ago when I first took over this car, I went to LCH to change my tyres, and was told to change my brake pads during my next servicing. During the replacement today, my existing pads are still in good condition but nevertheless, proceeded with the change and didn't probe furrher as the cost of the pads + servicing are still negligible. A bit disappointed though. I brought my own EO, pads, Spark plug, and oil filter. Breakdown as followed (in RM) 

1. Change spark plug 100

2. Change pads 150

3. Change EO and filter 25

4. Change ATF (yet to ask)

Everyone is different, you can mod according what you like and what you need. Don't have to max out the mods lah. But once you start modding, there will be more and more things that you want. E.g. You gain more power thus you want to brake fast as well - Install BBK  One mod leads to another.



I'm also driving Vios too, modded slightly because I want to have more stability while driving. Rims, lowered, K&N filter + CAI good enough liao  Some would go for ecu tuning once all mods are in, but I chose not to because I don't need it.

No worries. I'd say depends on your car's power to weight and your driving style. If anything under 130hp and 1300kg plus you don't drive very aggressively or track the car, don't really need slotted rotors.",26-03-18

Use only coolant next time. Water distilled or not is still water, when it boils become steam - any small tiny holes the steam will force it's way out and make the hole even bigger. Think of olden days Steam engine.

I dont object mod but totally agreed to what you plan to do; ""do up those that are necessary to me."" 1st.

Find a reliable workshop and soon enough you will get to know the inside out of the car upon more servicing and (hopefully not) repairs done.



Always stay around to looklookseesee and chitchat with the mechanic to 'understand' about the causes(root) of the problem.



Meanwhile enjoy the ride, as you are blessed.

Avoid KSL area at all cost.

99% are chop carrot shops cos rental too high there.

Ya its quite fun to learn about the car, how it operates n fix some simple stuff on ur own. From time to time, the knowledge we acquire will oso save us from being ripped off by some mechs/wkshops. 



Yrs ago, went to patch a tire. The dude told me that its time to change tires... knn my tires had more than 50% thread left n he said it can only last for a month. Lol...  



No prizes for guessing if i ever went back there again.



But it would be better if u can buy a car on your own without any support from anyone. Helps u understand the value of $$$$... of cos if you parents have more than enuff funds to retire n wants to loan u the money, its a diff story altogether.",23-03-18

			Ys Motorsports my honest feedback.



My first and last time. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this shop just went there. Felt like I was being treated like a big carrot. They only interested in doing one time business. Change mounting $280 exclude gst quotes than when I did research he cut down to $220 while elsewhere doing way cheaper around $150 I will suggest you doing your research if you really want to go down there if not sure kena carrot. The worker was still telling his boss how he charge me $95 per piece for a 2nd hand window switch I got 2 and laughing there. Bad bad experience will never ever step into that shop. Quoted me with gst and refuse to issue me receipt when payment for labour and insisted I had to pay gst if want receipt. Double gst lol!!! What a joke workshop I said no I need the receipt and I repeated multiple times that the worker quote me with gst and they angrily printed out with a black face (lady boss). Full of attitude workshop boss not friendly at all too

I understand if you have your doubts but for me I have no reason and benefit for me to frame others. Yes normally I am here to read and acquire deals however this experience made me take the effort to register. 



I felt like a big carrot and I hope people here would not experience the same as I went through with YS Motorsport Jb.



I hope they see this post and if they really want to try the workshop at least they are prepared before going down as I myself read the forum without comparing others and assume it was an honest shop.

dunno how bad your pest situation is. i think diy better... 



- clean and vacuum your seats, floor mats and carpets and trunk properly first. wash your mats with soap water and dry in the sun. make sure its completely dry before u put it back in.



- if there are stains on the carpets, use dishwashing solution mixed with water, vinegar and baking soda, and spray on the affected areas. scrub them off.  



- next sprinkle baking soda on the seats, carpets floor and trunk area... wait for about 15 mins and then vacuum it.



- next, park your car under the sun with all windows and door open for about 15 mins. 



- put a bundle of pandan leaves in the cabin area and 1 or 2 moth balls in the trunk. if dont want your balls to roll all over, put them in a small plastic bag, punch some holes and tie the ends.



- stop eating and drinking in your car. those crumbs and wrappers will attract insects very quickly... and always put in some effort to keep your car clean.",21-03-18

221, Jalan Dato Sulaiman, Century Garden, 80250 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia



From KSL you exit go down, will see the 24 hour car wash, turn left is go Holiday Plaza, turn right is leading to Da Ma Hua Yuan(Ah Piau wanton mee) that area, you turn right, the last car wash before the traffic light.



From Woodlands, pass the petrol kiosk, traffic light turn right will lead on to going to KSL. Once pass that hotel(Paragon) I think or Century, can't really remember, turn left. Car wash will be on your right. 



I don't know the boss's name. I only know he's around 160m+ , chinese and wearing those army black specs. I believe he's the only one who will walk up to customers and entertain because the rest are malay workers.

Embedded objects like nails/screws etc usually form their own semi seal so the tyre won't go flat immediately but it will lose pressure over time. There is a risk of the object shifting while driving and damaging the sidewall etc as well or entirely coming out which will then result in the tyre deflating quite quickly.",14-03-18

			I've read online that camber nut is not necessary and not critical item. But it is a common practice in alot of JB workshops. I think the nut is just to convenient them to align your tyres.



 Then again, since the stock is not adjustable, you may end up spending more to replace other parts so that your alignment is straight. So maybe this camber nut is a cheaper alternative to making your alignment straight



 You say their price is good but the quotation you stated is LCH charges more for engine mount compared to Singapore workshop?
		
		Click to expand...
	


I've had experience with JB workshop camber nuts as well. But not just in JB, even kenny alignment in SG also will ask you to install if need to. There was once i went to this tyre shop in jb and they adviced me to install. i told them no need. alignment was straight for a few months, after that, could feel that the car started to go sideways again. went to LCH, to change tires, they say need camber nuts, i went for it, and since 1 year back, it has been driving straight then. So i do think that the camber nuts help in some way or other.",08-03-18

I've read online that camber nut is not necessary and not critical item. But it is a common practice in alot of JB workshops. I think the nut is just to convenient them to align your tyres.



 Then again, since the stock is not adjustable, you may end up spending more to replace other parts so that your alignment is straight. So maybe this camber nut is a cheaper alternative to making your alignment straight

There is like 'no where' is good, it used tyres, they have, they will sell, dont have how to sell.



So goto ride around to be asking to see if you got.



Malaysia may sell cheaper BUT do 'inspect' it yourself and dont listen(worse trust) any of the tryeshop fellow as mostly are just concern to re-sell these used tyres for a profit.

They will tell you can de, no problem.

But buy at your own risk ba.



Still need check on the physical tyre condition BEFORE confirm the brand & model and importantly it's condition as in is it 'dry up' or very OLD tyres (eg 2011 tyre).",02-03-18

3 weeks back. went in to jb with a friend. on the way back to sg, i brought him to a car wash at pelangi. he ended up polishing the car there. quite comprehensive... wash, claybar, polish, wash, wax and vacuum. rm250 using sonax products. he was driving a suv. near the infamous shell station... lol...

Budget around RM800 for polishing. Would want a carwash that use quality products so that the shine can last for at least a few months. Oh also various parts of my car are wrapped with 3M vinyl sticker such as my hood and roof. Would polishing these areas adversely affect the integrity of the wrap? Thank you",22-02-18

Had my top and bonnet wrapped. 

Recently, when for a grooming session. 

The guy informed that they won't touch these two area as they worried polish might tear the vinyl. 

After much persuasion and with my assurance that anything wrong with the vinyl i would not hold them responsible, then the guy just did light polishing.",22-02-18

"Those countries that don't have COE/high expense for older cars type laws show which cars really stand the test of time. Australia is a good market to look at because labour is very expensive there so if an old car faces a large repair, they will most likely wreck(scrap) it for parts instead of pay a lot to keep it on the road. 



Keeping in mind everything mechanical eventually fails and a large factor in longevity is how the car has been kept by the owner(s). There are lots of older Mercs, Volvos and BMW's on the roads there. Newer models have actually been declining in part durability which has been the trend since way back after they realised if they make unbreakable cars, most people don't buy another one anytime soon and they go bankrupt.",15-02-18

Most of the items can just ask LCH for quote. It's not expensive. Buy the parts yourself = time + parking charges you don't save much.



The Malaysians are more mature in handling cars than sinkies. Nothing spoil no need to visit workshop except for oil change, tyres. Etc.

If it's your first time at the workshop better to stand around watch what they do.

For me I did the same when I visit LCH for the first time but after that didn't bother cos they really did a good job

These statement show how useless manufacturers and police are?

Or how impressive car's thevies are with $50 device? Lolol

In security circles this has been a well known vulnerability for well over a decade. There was a security consultant who wrote an open letter to car manufacturers about it which brought the issue into the mainstream spotlight almost a decade ago IIRC. 



The tools for the job have just become cheaper and easier to acquire since then. When I first heard about it, it costed about USD$50 for the electronics needed for a DIY device along with some know how. These days any idiot can buy ready made kits.

Correction

Engine mounting now I remember is SGD$900+ not SGD$1200 but still cheaper to change at LCH RM1850.



Starter

2 times within 2 weeks when I turn the key, no sound at all, not even that slight ""coughing""sound. Moreover even when starting the engine is successful, the sound is weird to me.



 ah yuan remove it and show me the whole spiral thing already loose(not supposed to) will uplorry anytime.



Usually when charges like this - around RM300+, I won't even bother to cross check the pricing in sg. Cos in sg SGD$100+ can't change anything.

I am rather particular to the starting sound of the engine. The rhythm should be consistent.

A slight ""coughing"" sound could mean either starter or battery/alternator.

And when this time round there is totally no sound at all - got to be the starter liao

			Definitely quality plays a part so must be careful, honestly i try not to buy car parts from taobao cos i cant see the quality until it reaches i ever bought car accessories then realise the quality abit jialiat lol, suay lor and for me 99% of the time i ask ws buy and use only original parts unless cannot get then i will buy and bring in. Some of the things the price difference is very big so i will get from stockist to bring in for him because Msia he can't get the parts anyway and if he gets, he buy from my stockist ship to him and then charge me so he says its higher.



(can ask Ah Yuan about me, i use original parts hahahaa) but if buy from stockist for me its buy original parts hahaha stockist got sell oem one ah? unfortunately for my car no oem for most things so most of the time i will get from ws but certain things ah yuan doesnt have (not all conti brands he can get) 



But i guess for Nissan Latio mounting, if Sg workshop, stockist and ah yuan using original parts and the price difference or stockist is 220, sg workshop i think he said is 400+ let say its oem and ah yuan 500+ lets say it's also oem then maybe have to see what our brother wants lor. I agree for him he have to also check whether the workshop gives oem or original parts... for me for mounting i only use original, used oem once, after one year kinda shaky didnt like it so change out, quite waste money

I am not good in car parts, not sure if its orginal or oem. I went to ERA auto today and Kelvin told me that my mountngs are indeed harden thus vibrates. And he also mentioned another issue was my fan belt which caused the engine rough sound when driving off. 



I didnt know that my regular ws installed oem fan belt for me though. No wonder when i collected my car and drove off the engine sound is diff. Then i went back to ask the next day he just said is engine mounting fault.",07-02-18
"I am too hahahaha so thats why i ask you so that i know what to look out for. cos wanna be prepared as my hearing of sound saved me a few times from dying battery or alternator



Everytime got abit of sound or what i will know and i will send to Ah Yuan.





Thats why sometimes they see me at YS last time they scared cos i can hear sounds they cant until ah chen says i paranoid feel like smacking him when he does cos always later true enough my drive shaft was failing or absorber or bearing making sounds lol.

"Depends on how old and how long more the car is. Next, does your nephew love the car?



If it was bought not too long, selling off though is a good option i would say but it is going to be a money losing option because firstly he hasn't paid much loan off and secondly with a faulty gearbox the dealers will take in at scrapped value (squeeze pricing) as their reason is - if the gearbox cannot fix we need to scrapped - which is also valid. So really depends on how old the car is and how long more to go and how long it has been bought to minimise loss



VW not very popular in Msia, the problem with VW gearbox failure, one of the causes was actually the gearbox oil - or so it was said in a number of forums as some have changed the correct type and thickness of oil and have no issues with the gearbox (apparently the AD didnt know until later on then they found out).



How long does Sg takes to replace and if sg is faster, you gotta find out why it is

For sharing usually for expensive items i will buy from stockist and get ah yuan to change or just get ah yuan to change, because im a regular customer, if anything faulty he can get me a replacement (of cos cannot be faulty after one year and get replacement)... just to share i ever bought absorber which was knocking after two months cos i got a lemon piece lor and stockists just shrugged hahahaha but if i go through a workshop at least can ask the boss to see if can get a new piece ... (i change absorber once every two years hahahaha) so just change in sg but ask that sg boss, if anything happens after one month how? cos i had my original mounting which YS first quoted me one price and upon payment it was 200 more zzzz and it was shaking and knocking during gear change went back thrice to rectify (pay alot of toll) finally ah yuan who came back from overseas that time strip the mounting for me and reinstall then ok le.... but at least they bother to entertain me hahahaha.



Best is to do with the sg workshop, but thing is if u buy from stockist and give the workshop the uncle can say your mounting quality issue, so best is to just do with him and make it his problem... thats what i will do unless the savings is so great that i can buy another sets of mounts, if its is abit of few dollars savings then take it as insurance lor. that is for me lah hahaha

5w40 is thicker than 5w30, unless your car is old or has high mileage or its turbo, don't use thicker oil if you wanna save fuel. you might press more gas hahaha.



Just for sharing. cos i have some friends who insist the thickness is denotes by the number infront so got one goondu went to buy 5w50 oil cos its cheap and insist can be use. i said yup go ahead lol the thicker the oil, usually its cheaper btw

Correction

Engine mounting now I remember is SGD$900+ not SGD$1200 but still cheaper to change at LCH RM1850.



Starter

2 times within 2 weeks when I turn the key, no sound at all, not even that slight ""coughing""sound. Moreover even when starting the engine is successful, the sound is weird to me.



 ah yuan remove it and show me the whole spiral thing already loose(not supposed to) will uplorry anytime.



Usually when charges like this - around RM300+, I won't even bother to cross check the pricing in sg. Cos in sg SGD$100+ can't change anything.

			Not everything is cheap in msia pls take note. because the parts they buy in jb can be more expensive than sg due to taxes. 



For sharing usually for expensive items i will buy from stockist and get ah yuan to change or just get ah yuan to change, because im a regular customer, if anything faulty he can get me a replacement (of cos cannot be faulty after one year and get replacement)... just to share i ever bought absorber which was knocking after two months cos i got a lemon piece lor and stockists just shrugged hahahaha but if i go through a workshop at least can ask the boss to see if can get a new piece ... (i change absorber once every two years hahahaha) so just change in sg but ask that sg boss, if anything happens after one month how? cos i had my original mounting which YS first quoted me one price and upon payment it was 200 more zzzz and it was shaking and knocking during gear change went back thrice to rectify (pay alot of toll) finally ah yuan who came back from overseas that time strip the mounting for me and reinstall then ok le.... but at least they bother to entertain me hahahaha.



Best is to do with the sg workshop, but thing is if u buy from stockist and give the workshop the uncle can say your mounting quality issue, so best is to just do with him and make it his problem... thats what i will do unless the savings is so great that i can buy another sets of mounts, if its is abit of few dollars savings then take it as insurance lor. that is for me lah hahaha

There can be quality difference for car accessories as well. I bought a fog light off taobao and brought over to Sheng Auto to fix up. 



Saw the same one there, but mine is plastic casing with low power led cob and his is metal casing with high power led cob. *facepalm*



I also brought a Cold Air Intake pipe over to install, mine wasn't long enough and couldn't extend to the place where I wanted it to be. Ended up I bought a CAI pipe from them, same design but it is long enough to fix it at where I wanted it to be *facepalm again*

I think you bought the ""wrong"" stuffs from taobao. Those that I bought from taobao compare with Sheng auto's - mine were way superior than theirs + cheaper. You need to know how to search for the best items in taobao, same item got at least 2-3 grades all selling at different prices but from the pic all looks the same.



Infact I did tell Jackson - he need to change his suppliers, the stuffs he got from his suppliers are way too expensive.

"Definitely quality plays a part so must be careful, honestly i try not to buy car parts from taobao cos i cant see the quality until it reaches i ever bought car accessories then realise the quality abit jialiat lol, suay lor and for me 99% of the time i ask ws buy and use only original parts unless cannot get then i will buy and bring in. Some of the things the price difference is very big so i will get from stockist to bring in for him because Msia he can't get the parts anyway and if he gets, he buy from my stockist ship to him and then charge me so he says its higher.



(can ask Ah Yuan about me, i use original parts hahahaa) but if buy from stockist for me its buy original parts hahaha stockist got sell oem one ah? unfortunately for my car no oem for most things so most of the time i will get from ws but certain things ah yuan doesnt have (not all conti brands he can get) 



But i guess for Nissan Latio mounting, if Sg workshop, stockist and ah yuan using original parts and the price difference or stockist is 220, sg workshop i think he said is 400+ let say its oem and ah yuan 500+ lets say it's also oem then maybe have to see what our brother wants lor. I agree for him he have to also check whether the workshop gives oem or original parts... for me for mounting i only use original, used oem once, after one year kinda shaky didnt like it so change out, quite waste money

Most or all EO now with API standard. My ride is a 8+ yo. Manual states 5W30. 

I switched between 5W30 and 5w40 during EO change. Not brand specific but is usually below $35/4L. 

And if you intend to add EO additives during EO change, i head from couple of parts shop in JB is a waste of money as the EO comes with additives oredi. Is a gimmick!

It's the viscosity of the engine oil that you need to watch out for.

			Hi guys.



What could be the cause for my problem; gear change not smooth, like can feel ""stuck"" awhile before changing gear. Last about a month ago, I consulted my regular mechanic and he suggest cleaning the transmission gasket/filter (not sure what he cleaned) and it worked. But now the problem came back. do I need to change the whole gasket/transmission filter?

Didn't know transmission filter can be cleaned. If it's not very costly, you can consider to do... start with the cheapest/simplest repair first. 



Likely he also checked that the ATF is deep red instead of brown? Before I changed ATF there's some delayed response in shifting, after the change it seems fine.



And... no need to go until batu pahat bro. JB can already, LCH bros can do.",18-01-18

From my knowledge after talking to a few scrapyard - in general SUV and MPV have the highest body price. Cos it's still in demand in 3rd world countries. Saloon and hatchback are the worst. Different conti got different value.

"As far as I understand the 5 appointed LTA scrapyards may seem to be offering the 'lowest body value' as everything can be done on the spot even on the last day too with the necessary stuffs needed (must be a working day) without much concern or worries.



https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/cont...vehicle/de-register/scrap_yard_operators.html



My friend just sent his car to an exporter agent directly, that seem to be offering the 'higher body value' if you car's make&model is in demand for it but you need to be doing the dealer's job by deregister yourself and later send the car disposal document yourself too.



And some 'dealer' offer to take in(buying over) your car; depend on made&model again; who pay you upfront cash for paper+body as they may either export your car, swap your car parts for sales or even renew and sell for profit.



So around a month before start calling around to ask for the best value of what is left in your car.

If really no time, just sent to LTA scrapyards and get it done and over with with hassle which quite a handful of thread talked about it before.

Yes there are lot of scammers.

The key point is not to sign any transfer form (M01) if the dealer is not buying over the car.

Else owner can kiss good bye to their Parf le.



Key point, dont sign blindly.

Actually quite alot of dealer doing this based on my friend's experience then.

He said lot can be found on Carousell, go ask for the best quota.



Do take note of 1 of a dealer's trick.

For eg;

They may offer you $500 for your car but when they, they will said your condition is not up to their standard and start to neg downward.

Polishing remove surface blemishing and stains.



Waxing is adding a layer of shine and temporary protection........not quite useful without Sealant.



Wax itself prolly last a week or less........sealant can allow it to last 3 mths or less.



I know some washing shop can negotiate for full wash, polish, wax and sealant for rm150 for normal sedan car........i last done at the washing shop opposite murder incident shell station.",01-01-18

his dad is actually there, i ask him why dun wan to hire more hands, he say he rather do the work himself so he can maintain his quality of work.

the 1st time i met him, i actually came before he even open so he can start the work early.

do inform him before you went down 

while waiting do try the stall that sell char kway teow behind his WS, there's also a fried chicken stall as well. you can request him to bring you to nearby the Store shopping centre, but there got limited stuff to see.... 

not only honda, other Japanese or korean brand car he can do as well. 

Just make sure you bring the correct parts in. 

but for continent car, he have some challenge in do, so best is not to engage him.

he himself say he also scare to touch european cars.

"Hi all, just wanna share my experience with YS Motorsports. 

I did a basic servicing in Singapore which the workshop highlighted quite a few issues and quoted me $1340sgd: 

- entire Lower arm replacement

- Brake pad 

- 3x belts (fan belt, serpentine? Not very sure what belts but not timing)

- spark plugs

- valve cover gasket

- atf oil, coolant 



I did a search on this forum and decided to heed the advice of some and drove in to YS. In the end they did a full check and replaced only the following after I tell them my COE only left with 1 year. 

-lower arm bushings 

-valve cover gasket

- 3x belts 

-spark plugs wire 

- atf oil, coolant



YS was honest and quoted what needs to be done as compared to what the SG ws quoted (lower arm VS bushings). Brake pads also not needed to replace. They also diagnosed the vibration was due to wire and not the spark plugs and mentioned my spark plugs can still be used for awhile (as opposed to what SG ws told me). In the end I spent about 900myr as compared to $1300+sgd. 

The only downside was the delay in servicing where they told me 2.5hours but ended up close to 5hours. But overall still a pleasant experience with them.  Can pm me if you guys want a breakdown in cost.",26-12-17

This is one of the major reason why I prefer to let the Malaysians have my biz. 



I used to have a brake problem, went to 3 workshops in sg - all asked me change this change that yet couldn't solve the problem. Closed to SGD$1.5K burnt.



Then I found a workshop in permas jaya who specializes in big MPV.

Problem not only solved in 30 mins, repair charges only RM400.

The crucial element of front+rear camera recording is to have a solid evidence during a car accident whereby the other party just couldn't play punk if it is his fault.



If your rear windscreen can easily fog up then u suggest you better change car.

Rims is also a very personal preference. Difficult to see photo to decide. you have to be there to see it and the feel it gives you its different from photos. Also different quality, material, weight and design cost different price



If you really really keen? Go to Batu Pahat for rims shopping. I brought a convey up before just to change rims lol. Its a rims supermarket when you go to the various tyre shops, see until cannot decide.

Gear fluid just need to know your car is auto transmission or CVT.



CVT will cost more and cannot put in normal ATF (auto transmission fluid)



If normal ATF just get the Toyota ATF from transglober.

Another alternative:

Usually send my ride to for servicing, electrical / mechanical repair/ replacement.



Boss is :Ah Chen @ +60127942588. 

LTEN PRO

23,Jalan Permas 9/9 Bandar Permas Jaya, 81750 Masai, Johor.



If you know what spare parts needed, you can buy at below spare parts shop and get it fixed at LTEN PRO



Hup Heng Auto Parts.

No 9, Jalan Permas 4/4, Tmn Permas Jaya, 81750 Masai , Johor.



Am heading to LTEN PRO next week, if you keen to join me, drop me a PM.



Other than those consumables parts, if noted any parts needed to be change, this boss will ask how long more to end COE then advise customer quick fix to ""tong"" till scrap car or change new ones.



Wont kena chopped!



BTW, i buy EO and bring into JB. EO in JB is surprising expensive than in sg. Other than EO, the rest of the consumable parts are cheaper in JB.

Headlamp change bulb no issue, if mod LED you need to find accessories shops that specializes in that. Stereos, audio are considered accessories.

			Wheel alignment problems can be the result of:

- Vehicle collisions

- Driving over a pothole

- Running into a curb

- Normal use over time

But if itâ€™s none of the above then I highly think that the car workshop you went to did not do a good job. I think that you should go back to the same one and tell them about it! They might even repair it for free if they know that it was their fault. After all, itâ€™s all part of a good after-sales service that can drive customers back.

ya went bk to them and the mech test drove the car again. checked tire pressure and insisted the alignment is ok.  



told me its normal all cars when driving will pull left because roads are build tilted so that water will flow away from the surface when it rains. not sure if he has friends who are real civil engineers but I'm pretty sure thats not the real reason why certain only roads needs to be slightly tilted. lol...",23-11-17

Bushings.

Forgotten what word/part...it's part of the steering.

The problem is quite specific, steering will turn to either left or right but not both sides. Usually is to the left.

I've heard a few horror stories though I'm sure most of the properly established shops are fine. There will definitely be those half past six types that will do anything just to get the car going. 



Worst I heard was a friend's friend sent his car to fix his suspension bushings cos worn out. He didn't monitor how they did the job and when he took the car back it seemed ok. After a few days started giving problems so he brought to a shop here, they opened it up and found one of the sides instead of the proper rubber bushing, they stuffed in cloth and some crap. Pretty messed up. 



I'd personally never send to a shop in JB that I didn't know myself or wasn't recommended by the bros here. We have little to no recourse if they mess our car up.",14-11-17

Motul and Pennzoil can be quite pricey but I've heard they're good. Castrol Edge or Mobil 1 is another one worth considering if you don't mind spending a bit more on EO. 



I'm still looking for stockists in SG/MY, one I've found that has good pricing is Lynlex located at Joo Seng Warehouse but they have limited products. The ones they stock are cheap though, like the Castrol Edge 5W40 is S$58 for 4L.



There are a few prepaid options for MY, I've also heard they have long validity ones from XOX Mobile etc but I haven't looked into those much myself because I go in quite often.",14-11-17

Some say just replace the one thats noisy but i had a friend who did that and several weeks later, the other side started making noise as well. Since the price is reasonable, just do it as a pair.

You see at UR website, currently on promo with 16mm @ 299 without installation. 



Price varies from car models i think.

I don't get you guys. Is there a need to dissect into my every sentence just to bring out points that are of little relevance. My only initial point and the one and only point is that JB workshops are not all good and I brought up a single example to show why. You guys don't seem to buy it, latching onto me like i'm flaming the JB workshops. Like i said you guys are free to do whatever you want, the causeway would not be empty because of my posting.



Since you guys are so interested in my uncle i should share abit more. He earns in excess of sgd50k a mth. X5 is just his 1 of many cars and he services them all in SG. He goes to JB every few weeks with the sole purpose of visiting his parents. That day he felt the car had abit of balancing problem after reaching jb so his friend suggested letting the workshop take a look. The irony is that he was not looking for any cheap deal. Anyway he has moved on, so let's move on as well.",25-09-17

Yes let's move on.

Just a wrong choice.



I also had bad experience with a so-called regular workshop in jb.

Was wanting to change a belt, the head mechanic said got stock and ok.

Took out the belt, i waited & waited.

Suppose to be a quick job(10~15 mins), but waited for 45mins still nothing done as he said need to order and get the delivery guy to send the belt over.

After an hour plus, here come my belt.

Try fixing it for 5-10mins still cannot fit in(i was there standing and seeing by the way).



So I asked them why huh? Something wrong?

Then they comparing my orginal belt to the new belt and then realised their new belt is thicker...faintzzzz.



Said need to wait again. I wasnt happy for sure, told them i need to rush le cant wait and get them to fit back the original belt & go.



So my point is that, things happened.

If i am not around, who's knows what they will do?

Maybe will force the belt in hard and break something else?



So my point to many who visit workshop(esp in jb), stay and watch.

I doubt they dare to cheat on you when you watch over what is done.



Will too suggest the same in sg if possible thou many feel safer but you never know.



Anyway thanks for sharing really.

Likewise if your uncle feel time wasting to see what is going on while repair or troubleshoot, AD should be the place for him for any car ba.

1st time there and left car there & go jalan?



Whenever I go workshop in jb(even sg), will make an effort (kinda must for me) to stay there watch, talk and hopefully understand what is done. Beside the point to know your car better, how to trust people to handle your car with key given?



For eg, those send for car wash, i even drive my car as sometime they need to shift it for vaccuum etc etc.

Many do heard of cases how car was gone after car wash right.

He was born Malaysian and live there for 20-30 years before becoming Singaporean. Hardly 1st time.



Johorians themselves have no faith in their own people. They call JB a cowboy town. In fact those you should be more wary about people with the glib tongue, talk and talk until you are happy. 



To Singaporeans JB is = 1:3. Nothing else matters.



To Johorians, Singaporeans = $$$. Nothing else matters.

I doubt if he stay at workshop watch what is going on, such issue may not arise.

So not all workshops in jb or sg is bad, just a wrong choice of workshop plus he really took it for granted even you mentioned he was there for 20~30 years.

			I have a bad experience over at this shop. And is my first and last. Changed aircon filter and they installed the new filter incorrectly. Discovered it when i send my ride for a air con system cleaning at another shop away from KSL area. 

Since then, i avoid those ws over at ksl.  



Prices over that whole stretch of ws near ksl is expensive. Mostly target for SG cars.

			Just spotted this post and like to share my 'bad experience' about this Ah WEE (opp KSL).



I bought 3rd party alarm and plan to bring it in JB to get it done (as labour cost is cheaper there thou).



Was there rather early then as wasn't caught in any jam in.

Ah Wee shop open pretty early at 9+am which I think most shop start around/after 10am.



Asked him about the cost of installation as I wanted to do a boot-release with it too(it a given yet optional function).



He quoted me installing of alarm at rm180 and if I need to do the boot function additional rm80.

Total of rm260, which I feel it not cheap at all (almost the price to install in sg thou).

So I politely told him I will think about it and was to leave.

He then, said if I do now he charge rm60 for boot release cost which I still declined and said will think about it.



Went for breakfast and drive around.

asked a 2 other workshops, both quote me rm150.



I do not know how 'good' the workmanship of this AH WEE can be but for sure am not paying for the price quoted(close to SG rate wor)



So be warned when going there to get things done.

If got time to spare, try to compare a few workshops.



Just my 2cents worth for what happened just recently(less than 1 month).

I tried Ah Wee, dunno which Ah Wee cuz there's so many Ah Wee. So I drove in to one of the Ah Wees one fine day to try out if it's really chop carrot.



Asked for change of coaxial speakers left & right door, was quoted RM100 with mounting brackets. Realised no need these brackets, he collected RM50 from me instead.

Likely backplate's contact points needed some copper grease/anti-seize.



Not sure if the drums were cleaned out and greased when i replaced the brake shoes cuz i went to have breakfast nearby. 



Went back a few times, was told adjustments were done but squealing sound persists. Then i was told to replace brake drum if problem is still there.. the drum is still ok leh from what I observed.

yes wiring stuff go look for wire experts. non wire stuff look for mechanic. tyre stuff shops/mechanic that sells tyres and do alignments and if aircon, best is to go aircon expert to do, same for car body - go to a panel and spray/body expert to do (you can't go tyre shop to fix your car mirror or signal or repair a dent).

you fix body kit also must spray paint, BTS might be able to do, but this kind of job, you need to call to see if he has, then go down see catalogue which one you want and give a deposit, then go back in another day.it is very leychey.

"I met one of LCH staff at the mall the other day, he mentioned that they tried to fix but if it wasn't fix why didn't you turn back to look for them, they would have fixed it again or try to even though they are not wire experts. he mentioned that from what he knows ah yuan didn't charge you for the signal and did it for you out of goodwill and i told him i read about it online, he felt it wasn't very nice to flame lch like that esp it was done foc since you did oil change with them.

I'm with your friend n you on this.  If the shop has been providing myself with good services throughout a long relationship, I won't give two hoots from a random bad review.



I've asked around, they may have over top up my eo out of concern that my 7yo car might be 'eating' eo. So benefit of doubt given here.



Moving on... That just wasn't my day, probably was a bit irate as the 2 issues bugging me wasn't fixed. Cheers!

			I met one of LCH staff at the mall the other day, he mentioned that they tried to fix but if it wasn't fix why didn't you turn back to look for them, they would have fixed it again or try to even though they are not wire experts. he mentioned that from what he knows ah yuan didn't charge you for the signal and did it for you out of goodwill and i told him i read about it online, he felt it wasn't very nice to flame lch like that esp it was done foc since you did oil change with them. I haven't check in with Ah Yuan tho.



Are you able to confirm?

"i know him for 9 years, just that these few months i didn't contact him much after he went to lch, only went twice to do my car, he/lch can't be that bad and he is a man of passion and integrity, of cos he isn't 100% perfect but he still tries his best... also if its a foc service then its really not nice to write until like they are so incompetent and not recommendable.



he is still my go to most trustable mechanic. Im asking him to order window visors for me for two of my cars, he is not accessories shop but still tries cos we are friends for so long

			Bro.. how much was the Labour for fixing your front and back camera? Tap to ignition?
		
		Click to expand...
	


tap to ignition. FOC cos did lights... we are regular customers so we get foc services that is the perks of working so closely with ah yuan and making him my only mechanic.



Ah yuan is very nice mechanic, if you do your car with him and if it doesn't cost him parts but alittle bit of his time, I believe he will do it at no cost. I am pretty sure Hoseboh signal that he complained about that he did with LCH was done at NO charge or cost to him, if it's not on the receipt its not charged, he is not the kind that slaughter you here and take from there. Because he is a very honest mechanic who is passionate about his work. If its done as a free service i dun think its fair to complain and discredit him or his shop esp if it was done at no cost. Unless he did charged and if he did, can brother Hoseboh care to share your receipt with us?



Another friend who was at dinner was sharing with us that her car got into an accident near Seremban, she called her YS and LCH for help, YS respond only the next day (but at least he reply), but LCH responded immediately, ah yuan was in Australia at that time somemore, but instructed Ah Hong to manage, it was Hari Raya holidays so they called a few tow trucks and finally ordered a tow truck from jb to go all the way to Seremban to pick the car to go back to LCH. Waited 4 hours because tow truck needed to drive to Seremban and cannot speed, and loaded up and went back another 4 hours. In that 4 hours alot of tow trucks who were touts were hawking around the car, more than 10 came by to offer to pull to their workshop and one even had to call LCH to get them to speak to the tow truck drivers to buzz off. Finally pulled all the way to LCH and ah Hong was there at 1030 to greet my friends.



 My friend gave ah hong a big ang bao to bring his wife for a nice meal cos they were there camping and waiting for the tow truck. This kind of service where to find. Friend paid tow truck driver and they went their way. Its not like LCH took a kick back from the tow truck. Next day 1130, Ah Yuan and Ah Hong put my friend's car back together, only one thing was charge which was radiator and they replace that radiator leaking and fix back the aircon belt was dislodged, they even fix back the bumper that fell out at no cost and without needing to bring back to BTS. However Ah Yuan mentioned to me that tow truck services he will only do for regular customers, those who have a working relationship with him more than 5 years (those go once a year not counted) or if he did your car more than 20 times with him and your car is solely and fully done by LCH from oil changes to tyres to parts replacement etc and he knows you then he will consider. Otherwise if the tow truck reach there nobody and go back, he will need to pay.



If you ask me, these are perks of having your own trusted mechanic in JB that you use all the time. Not cos here cheap there cheaper by rm10 so i go, then no point. No point your mechanic call you back the next day. Also when you need someone to talk to the touts they can.",21-08-17

Dear Laksafan,

1. I went Gosford, went LCH, went BTS. My experience with these 3 shops, good i write good, disappointing i also write.

2. I can understand your passion to speak up for them as per your postings.

3. Hope you understand that i don't know them, what i write are based on what i have experienced and these are my pov. I have no hidden agenda against or for any of these shops, just a normal consumer.

4. Also that things don't always work out the way you want 100% of the time regardless your intention maybe. Good chance it will be different to others.

			I just went to LCH and spoke to Yuan. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this workshop and will never go there again.



Did the following. 



1. Changed engine oil - they over top up,  way past the upper marking by a lot. 

21Aug - Already updated previously that this maybe due to 'old car eat eo' syndrome, so they top up more. benefit of doubt.



2. Tried to fix my side mirror unable to close -  they can't fix it. Came back SG n fixed in 10 mins. 

21aug- I admit this is free but lets not start saying free means must keep quiet. Coz that is never true. I've already stated that i asked prior to visting them and if they cannot fix this n the issue below, why do i need to go all the way there? There are recommendations of Hawk tayar, etc to do the rest on my list. (You see my point here, i'm sianz but maybe they are checking for me out of good will.)



3. Tried to fix my turning signal light which stop ticking after a few ticks by itself - told me rectified but spoil again before I can even get out of jb. Came back SG n fixed by changing the spoilt relay. 

21 aug- Look, its only a relay change, when it failed again i was already on my way out of JB. Honestly at that point of time i'm already fully sianz. Let me reiterate that they say it is fixed.

Refer to point 3, i don't know them and not sure what they do or don't, i asked before i go. . You may say that engine go mechanic, body go spray paint shop, etc. The line is never fine.

(Again, you see my point here, i'm sianz but maybe they are checking for me out of good will.)



4. Changed atf - I think also over top up, it's way past any markings on the metal stick. (not sure here) 

21aug- same as eo issue.



5. Change front brake pads -  now I can hear more screechings more frequently than before the change. 

21aug - Although i did update that the screeching sounds are gone the next 1 or 2 days, i've been hearing intermittent screeching sounds still, till today. 2 tanks leow. Again, give them the benefit of a doubt maybe because my rotor not smooth already, but my old pair of brakes swee swee till need to change.



Bought the pads n atf from them,  total cost all in rm520. Price is fine but not worth going again.

Dear Laksafan,



You have contributed so much here and i don't think you have to take such a drastic step. IMO, as long as there are more and more validations on the good work that LCH is doing, the readers here are capable of deciding for themselves what's good. There are so many here saying that they have went or are going down, surely not a problem.



This is just like any other shops or businesses where if they get 100 reviews, i'm pretty sure a few will not be so nice. In fact this makes them feel real. Personally i will be skeptical of one with 100% 5 stars good reviews.



I understand you are on good terms with them, perhaps you can let them know that i've explained here that this is a once off thing and as i've stated earlier sometimes this is just a misunderstanding of expectations.



Thanks, i hope we can move on from this episode. Sharing is caring.",21-08-17

2. From my experience - Some new brake pads does have screeching sound but ok after run in, dun take oem if u can next time with other workshop.



Do note that they are not wire man or accessories shop, apart from under the bonnet i dun recommend letting mechanic touch any wires. Regardless sg or msia. like if u wanna do a radio system, do not go to a mechanic but an Accessories shop to do for good reason.

"I just went to LCH and spoke to Yuan. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this workshop and will never go there again.



Did the following. 



1. Changed engine oil - they over top up,  way past the upper marking by a lot. 



2. Tried to fix my side mirror unable to close -  they can't fix it. Came back SG n fixed in 10 mins. 



3. Tried to fix my turning signal light which stop ticking after a few ticks by itself - told me rectified but spoil again before I can even get out of jb. Came back SG n fixed by changing the spoilt relay. 



4. Changed atf - I think also over top up, it's way past any markings on the metal stick. (not sure here) 



5. Change front brake pads -  now I can hear more screechings more frequently than before the change. 



Bought the pads n atf from them,  total cost all in rm520. Price is fine but not worth going again.",06-08-17
"Wow thats sucks.



But to check



1. you check the dip stick in the morning or while engine is still hot? as well as your atf?



2. From my experience - Some new brake pads does have screeching sound but ok after run in, dun take oem if u can next time with other workshop.



Do note that they are not wire man or accessories shop, apart from under the bonnet i dun recommend letting mechanic touch any wires. Regardless sg or msia. like if u wanna do a radio system, do not go to a mechanic but an Accessories shop to do for good reason.



Will take note, if their standard drop for me i will boycott too, thanks for sharing.

Im sure they say ok, but dun let a mechanic touch wiring, they are not train for it. I prefer to choose wire experts to do my car for me, on the side note someone bang my mirror once and my AD wanted to charge me $700 sing but YS motorsport both Ah Chen and Ah Yuan then fix my mirror tog for me for free, it was  wire that disconnected from the source (just gotta reconnect) and not motor spoil like the agent said, only that time. Other than that, only plug and play like my power window switch then i let them touch - simple plug and play then i think its ok, but anything to do with relay etc better give to an expert, later the car fry",06-08-17

There was a recent query about the camber nut issue at LCH, i did change too cos i am particular about it... i checked my receipt that i also changed the camber nut thingy at a much higher price at YS motorsport (home of where LCH mechanic were born lol) which one of the alignment guy told me to change, i just check my receipts before throwing all out (too many receipts which i kept for servicing record lol but too many so threw out since not selling car)...

"Most shops will ask you to replace camber arm, nut is for adjusting, can do without if you not comfortable. can always tell them next round - applies to all workshop.



I speed alot in my car so i did do the nut replacement, it helps. If you drive fast and you know alot about cars Dynamics, then you will be fussy about alignment and you will know why you should do alignment.. But if you are a point A-B driver dun bother with the nut or the arm. Unless your car bang or mount kerb big time before or many times and after alignment its still not fully straight (again its depends how fussy u r)

			May i know what car are you driving? I was charged RM65/pc for camber nut. Not upset about price difference, just curious why is there price discrepancy. I'm driving avante by the way. 



I also read that camber nut is actually not needed but almost all workshops across the causeway will offer this because it is easier to rectify/solve issues with the nut.

			Hello all! I'm driving a Swift Sport and I'm planning to renew my car COE and so decided to do the car Swee Swee before I do that. Planning to go in this Thursday to do a lot of things, after seeing all the Bros recommendation, here is the list of things I've gathered. If anyone don't mind please feel free to advise me if there is a better place that I should go, I'll appreciate any advise or recommendation.



Problem: Aircon not cold after stuck in jam for too 20mins and above. Decide to diagnose at the below workshop



Syarikat Fuji Car Cooler



15, Jalan Perang, Taman Pelangi, Johor Bahru, 80400, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80400, Malaysia

+60 7-332 6820



Problem: Speaker wiring seems to have problem. Also deciding whether to do sound proofing depending on the cost.



Sheng auto. 

92, Jalan Bukit Kempas 1/18, Taman Bukit Kempas,

Johor Bahru





Problem: coolant water need to TOP up almost once a week



LCH Brother 

2 Jalan Perkasa 3 Taman Ungku Tun Aminah 81300 Skudai Johor Malaysia



Lastly, I'm looking for a workshop to do re upholster work for my seat, can anyone kindly recommend a good shop please?



I'll be staying there for a few days so no problem Travelling or staying late or whatever. Any recommendation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance !

"No problem bro... good to know its helpful



Also a small tip for all brothers here and for all brothers who intro friends, besides all of you pls tell your friends not to bargain with any workshop in jb... the reason why alot of JB workshops near the causeway like to chop sg cars cos according to syrakit fuji aircon boss (was chillin with him) he says that everyone come ask for discount, some will beg and lose temper and be persistent on a discount when it is very cheap already (they too have rental and overheads)... so many workshops who encounter such nonsense one too many time, will start to charge higher, so that when the person ask for discount will still pay the same price as they originally quoted but not without saying many no(s) first and if they are lucky they get to charge higher that it normally would have....



So some workshops over the years become very expensive, because Singaporeans go there and bargain alot.... (some pple not just bargain but they literally beg! seriously, dun sia suay)





what was embarrassing was that its always the sg cars that will bargain... i was like no im not gonna bargain with u hahahaha

i went to change tires with LCH a few weeks back. Now i know who you were talking about when you said ah yuen took someone with him from ys. Its the guy with specs. When i arrived at LCH, i asked the specs guy if he still remember me. He say, of course! Probably because i was the one who was sticking with him when he was doing his job at YS. He was cleaning my throttle body and left one of the coolant hose unplugged. I handed him a spark plug to plug the hose. He said ""eh, still not bad ah"" i just laughed at him. 



what i don't understand is that the price LCH quoted me from facebook is slightly different from the price that was charged to me at the shop. I didn't ask nor nego as the price was still cheaper than SG but somehow i feel ah yuen and ah chen pricing method might be different. Ah Yuen like to quickly jack up your car and make you feel obligated to do with them. As for Ah Chen, he will tell you whats wrong and tell you the price before doing the job. Do you agree? Because of this, i may stick to YS for other things except tires and go to LCH just for tires.",24-06-17
"i dun have that problem... but if the price online is different u should tell them cos different pple reply to it



you can always ask him to diagnose first 

ys always jack up my car if its an under the hood problem. if it's things like wheel bearing, absorber etc then they will diagnose. there were times that ah chen gave me wrong diagnosis, i spend close to $7k sing for wrong diagnosis over 4 years. So sometimes its annoying, esp aircon problems when you need it to work esp... he messed up my car because he couldnt diagnose a wire in the sensor broke and that went on for one year since it was an intermittent issue (everything can changed I change already from new throttle body to all sensors change new and even a whole aircon system, change air con car kept stalling cos too much gas or some crap.... all is ah chen do one and when ah yuan or other mechanic want to check further he will scold them and tell them dun bother cos it this issue, that issue, leaving me no choice but to change according to what he says and it still doesn't work - its always the intermittent issue), finally i brought to a mechanic in Macpherson, he found the problem in 2 mins... Ah chen messed up an expat (angmoh) Peugeot earlier this year, i had to be translator, ah moh came to his work shop 5 times in 3 weeks and he was very upset. it was a very simple problem (a sensor issue, the sensor wasn't sitting properly), he made the guy change 3 aircon compressor from oem to oem to original etc etc. Even call two electrician to come with computers like some big shot car.... The guy was really upset and kept telling ah chen its an electronic or electrical issue but he boh bian cos he put in alot of money there already....



There were times that ah chen could have claim back stuff from the supplier when the parts fail he didnt do it for me (prob did and pocket the money) so end up it was ah yuan and ah keong who told me can....



after 8 years abit sian.... but honestly over the years YS serve me ok so i stayed on it is only need to have two to three times they coxk it up damn bad that you understand..



why i left ys for lch, is when i had an issue for 4 years ah chen cannot diagnose keep saying its aircon issue when i know its not (he told me i need to change out my 1 year old compressor which i didnt drag for 4 years) and it was ah keong who found the problem - the valve cover rubber and solve my problem zzzz also his aircon metre is different reading from 3 shops i went around jb... his red valve is super high so it makes u think your condensor has issue. So aircon stuff always go syrakit to check

I know it's more or less the same but it would be good if they know how to work on these euro 5 engines. They are so sensitive and the electronics sometimes give you headache.

that sounds jialiat. u wanna service car go reliable workshop like YS or LCH, i left my cars over night with both before no issues.... left a 125i there before overnight as well, still powerful lol. But i must highlight that the swapping out of spareparts i heard of such stories 15-20 years ago but in the last 10 years never heard of anyone kena such things before even though i work in JB or KL, however if it happened *15-20 years ago maybe could happen but those are confirm not legit workshops those are crooks. However base on what this brother is saying we are unable to establish if the friend's car is a second hand car or a brand new car that he has all along. 



Recently helped a friend - my friend's dad bought a second hand Nissan less than a month before he passed away in his sleep, when we check the car some parts were oem and giving problems send back to Tan Chong to change back to original parts cost over a thousand to get it fixed and replace.... second hand car not sure agent crook or the previous owner a cheapskate or his Sg mechanic (got the servicing label) is a crook



Anyway those unfamiliar just hang around and watch the workshop work

I tried them for replacement of tyres back in January.

and asked for the servicing as well bringing my own engine oil.



They have transparent pricing displayed on counter. Don't think will get ke tok.



But they can only do basic servicing and tyres rotation and if you have concern about some car issues...they cannot do much because they specialised in tyres.



Their service is not bad for tyres and basic stuff.



Suggest you to go elsewhere if you are looking into in-depth servicing and troubleshooting.",08-05-17

2) shell hylux ultra 5w 40- 35.90

How to check oil change really done ? Check dip stick before and after?



How to check oil filter really done?



Oil filter must change how often ?



Mechanic say I forgo the 25 or 33 point check as it is free if do with 118sgd. But this one I can't check if they do or not so I say don't want. Is it wise?

Always ignore the digits in front of the W, it's only meant for countries with winter although some smart Alec will tell you your engine will be freezing cold around minus 5 degrees after leaving it in the car park(Singapore) for 10 hrs.



The other 2 digits are the viscosity ~ layman terms means thickness of the oil. The higher the number the thicker it is.

For those who wants to know, the reason why YS was good besides the boss Ah Chen is a good Mechanic, their number 1 man is Ah Yuan who started his own business and I will be jumping ship soon cos got two to three times the workshop cock up modified stuff for me and gotta bring down again when Ah Yuan is not around so abit annoying.

"Price wise can earn alittle bit not to worry, but very little, sometimes its more like marketing because they hope to build customer rapport and hope customer can come back for other repairs in the future. Something like those $3.90 haircut, can earn? yes and no.. yes because haircut is a service and skills, no because rental of shop is ex but sometimes pple go and shun bian colour hair and rebond etc thats how they earn.



So no worries definitely not a scam.



Actually their main cost is the engine oil, oil filter, wiper and flush.



Shell sounds like fabulous because they have petrol stations but trust me, those who knows car will tell you that Shell Synthetic is a very normal engine oil, basically it is not the best but it is still a good engine oil and definitely usable Giant was selling it for $38.90 last week so if you less off Giant's profit that will give you a gauge of how much it cost so $38 for servicing is quite ok can earn. For some people Mobilone is more preferred over Shell by some fans who says its a very very good oil, and of cos there is a group who are pro Castrol. More expensive engine oil will be redline, motul, LiquiMoly. Again those who are into cars will be into engine oil. Otherwise to most people actually all e.o are the same. 



There are some who are not fussy, some feels that the e.o does it job its ok, some are comfortable with a particular brand and they swear by it, some found cheap and good e.o like schnell and carlube which i have tried, they are quite good and definitely usable and carlube is really not bad for the price. Of cos there are also people like my ex boss they can't tell the difference they only know how to drive, he will say dun ask me i dunno hahahaha. So don't worry so much at the end how good the e.o, its all up to individual and it is to lubricate the engine so that is all that matters. To each its own



I suggest dun take the flush if you are not certain of the engine condition, later flush already got gunk stuck in the piston or something will be a headache. The best way to flush is buy cheap engine oil and filter do a short run then flush.



This package can consider if you are not intending to do other things.



In your concern of whether it is worth to go jb, well for most of us who use other e.o like liquimoly and motul, the pricing in JB is alot better, we do tyre rotation, wheel balancing and alignment as well, sometimes we change brake pads and spark plugs etc.



So if you are doing an oil change, technically you can do in SG and take on the package its very good value. But if you wanna do repairs or other stuff there is a reason why pple go jb, because of the exchange rate. Still can go shopping, eat, pump petrol and wash car along the way. Cannot explain lah, only those goes jb will understand.



No right no wrong. So long as it works.

Cheapskate or not, I bring my own oil. Different shop probably has different price for oils. But I'm sure you can save a bit more in Malaysia. If you decide to do anything in jb, you will also need a local workshop in case of emergency. Unless you want to spend 800rm towing into jb. For engine overhaul works, even after adding in the tow fees, it may still be worth it. Bit back to your question, I will buy better oil in Singapore and bring into jb.",21-04-17

If you want special oil like Castrol and Redline also buy and bring in cos not many places carry them. Shell, MobilOne, Idemitsu, Motul, Liquimoly will be common to find, YS and LCH shld have Idemitsu and Liquimoly. If you want the no brand but decent engine oil which some mechanics buy, can get from CK auto (stockist) in my post below. But best value for E.O if you not going for brand, buy from SG hypermarket and bring in. Get from stockist air filter, oil filter if you need in sg too.



For everything else in SG, if my car whatever problem so far thank God its ok cos i maintain it well, i use Tan Lim Motors. They are an all in one workshop from engine to bodyworks. If you are using ntuc insurance and kena some **** from other users can go there, they do accident claims and reporting too

How to check oil change really done ? Check dip stick before and after?



How to check oil filter really done?



Oil filter must change how often ?



Mechanic say I forgo the 25 or 33 point check as it is free if do with 118sgd. But this one I can't check if they do or not so I say don't want. Is it wise?

"Dude dun let ws scare you.... most ws that i mention will check for you all your car fluids - oil etc... if you want ask them check your alternator and battery as well... these are free no need to pay. i never pay for mine before cos i usually service with agent for other cars and my workhorse i service in jb (i follow handbook though, every 20-30k i change auto gear box oil, brake pads and brake fluids. power steering oil and coolant every 50k) i do it for a peace of mind since its 40% cheaper already i use the savings to care for my car and because its a workhorse i cannot afford not to take care as i cannot afford to be stranded somewhere in Msia... for me only alternator and battery every 20k i check together with the tyres. 



as for digital diagnostic unless your dash board lights up with symbol otherwise - if it ain't broken don't try to fix it...



nothing to diagnose then no need... just check brakes, tyres, alternator, battery in good condition plus all the fluids are in good condition and change properly can already. wipers also check if blurry blurry change, also buy those rain x to put on windows, windshield and mirrors i recommend Maxpower rm10.90 in Tesco cheap and very good, not hazy unlike all i tried in market, vision is important. get workshop check all your lights, brake lights for you as well..if you never change power steering, brake and gearbox oil before i suggest you do so since your car is 10 years old. Gearbox, power steering unit can be quite hefty to replace if it spoils, the fluid very cheap only less than $100 just get it done once and have a peace of mind. (gearbox is in the thousand btw in sgd too even if you change in jb, because alot of work needed as well, power steering unit isn't cheap either).



actually for oil filter, msia can get it cheaply next time get from the workshop less than rm20. unless you changing in sg then just buy from whoever... change oil must change filter... cannot wash and reuse



btw your tyres of rm240 is over-priced if they are not giving you a made in Spain/Jap/Korean tyres - not for below 15 inch... i changed for one msia car in Nov last year 14 inch for rm170 only, hankook somemore and that was already abit ex. I check with LCH Proxy or Kumho tyres 15 inch for swift around rm160-170. Change two tyres he will include air-valve, change four he will include alignment. YS has other brands too but alignment is separate charge. your rm240 abit overpriced if it's those no brand one so again depending on brands

Ok I will give you all a list of workshop to go to that I used before and they are good.



I work in JB. Running in and out so I need workshop contacts lol.



Those wondering if I open workshop or have a share the answer is no. So thats why I am giving you a list. Also I went to so many before I got my list of workshop. Got carrot before also. so i pay tuition fees but at the end I found these who are good and been using them for 3-7 years no problem. I can leave my car there and walk away, no problems. I go for honest owners only, because the last thing you want is they swap out your engine or your cashcard passport missing. Or tell you this and that spoil must change.



1. If you get into an accident, scrapped the wall or hate the colour of your car how?



Go to:



BTS Painting Workshop

46, Jalan Indah 16/11, Taman Bukit Indah, 81200 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia.



He takes cash only



(It is opposite Tesco near the circle, those who needs direction PM) Otherwise google for Bts Painting Bukit Indah and get the directions from Google



Near BTS there is a workshop called Chiang Auto few door away nia. He specialise in BMWs so BM owners can find him. But he is not cheap just that its cheaper than SG. But Beemer drivers he will give you an accurate diagnosis having done so many cars.



Next up. Jap and Msian made cars this is what you do



1. If you dunno the problem

Go to CH Auto Service (Boss is Michael)



No.122, Jalan Lembah, Taman Tasek Johor Bahru, 80200, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80200, Malaysia



Takes cash mainly, but can try ask him for cc. No Amex no diners





2. Get the diagnosis and if need to change parts walk over to a stockist called 



CK Auto Spares (Stockist takes credit card no amex no diners)

85-87, Jalan Glasiar, Taman Tasek, 80200 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia



And get the parts, walk back to CH auto and give the guy to fix.



But if you already know the problem, buy from Stockist in Sg and bring in to fix.



4) For everything else you are not sure go to

YS Motorsport (Boss is Ah Chen, takes credit card no amex no diners pls)

2G, Jalan Bestari 8/5, Taman Nusa Bestari, 81300, Skudai, Johor, 81200, Malaysia



He does tyre alignment as well, quite cheap, depends on make of car. He drives two generations of 5 series so he is also quite familiar with Beemer. Nowadays alot of Singaporean go there too.. I think they read my post in other forums. There is a prata stall next to the workshop called zam zam which has nice prata.



Toilets is cmi.



Chiang Auto and BTS can walk to Tesco or Jusco but its abit of a walk. The rest no malls nearby. So please kindly download Grab app (thanks to Grab, last time need to sit in workshop for hours and hours... now no need cos got Grab)



If need anything google for the name and get the information before you set off.





Aircon specialist please go to this shop for your aircon problems. Do not go to YS Motor or anyone else that specialises in car engine etc to fix aircon they are not aircon expert, they might be a tad cheaper but whats the point of paying RM500 to these shops and cannot fix the problem and spend more and more money. Unless you know the issue otherwise i advise  against because I paid alot of money before. Tell me compressor I change a whole compressor then found out its fan motor, when my compressor is only 3 year old. No point paying abit cheaper like  rm500 that cannot fix as oppose to RM600-700 to one that can. Top up gas ok, but diagnosis not ok, confirm tell you compressor (everyone else always say compressor cos its convenient no need diagnose and can earn alot) when it could be just a washer etc. The changed for me my aircon coil, clean up everything, added oil to my compressor, which most normal car workshop cannot do. So if they are aircon specialist ask if they can add oil to the car compressor. my aircon is perfect till today still cold when everyone else tells me its compressor. Same for SG, go to car aircon specialist. They know what they talking about.



Syarikat Fuji Car Cooler

15, Jalan Perang, Taman Pelangi, Johor Bahru, 80400, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80400, Malaysia



I paid RM600 for aircon coil + cleaning up + new filter, removal of all aircon gas + re-top up of gas with oil + washing and cleaning of aircon blower (best is ask them not to wash cos sometimes never dry properly can short circuit or spoil. ask them wipe clean) as opposed to RM450 for aircon coil and top up gas.(no oil). Cash only



Up to you guys to decide what you guys wanna do or where to go. Those need anymore info can pm me if I didn't reply here.

Bro, you're the minority that says JB stockists are cheaper than SG's for original parts. Majority said SG cheaper? Care to share the stockist location so can benefit the bros here especially regarding bulky items which is difficult to ""smuggle"" into JB",02-03-17

			Guess he is not your meat/vegetable ba lol.

As believed, one man's meat is another man's poison but not yours. =Ã—



And am saying he is reasonable, not the cheapest thou so pricing everyone should ask around and do your homework what/who workshop/mechanic is worth it?
		
		Click to expand...
	


You are talking utter nonsense here, you better do your homework before spewing more garbage here. Personally I've dealt with him a few times and he always marked up his prices on parts as well as labour charge, super ex indeed !!!










	
	
		
		
			Hhmmm as for sky high pricing?

For servicing maybe(it's $100+; depend on what EO you chosen) as he have his own EO, etc.



But I usually did my basic servicing; elsewhere as I do BYO stuffs to workshop to get it done at with labour cost( mainly in JB =P )
		
		Click to expand...
	




If he is reasonable as you claimed then may I know why you service your car in JB, why not let Ah Heng service your car 










	
	
		
		
			Otherwise my personal experiences(a couple of times too) was good as in he knows Honda's cars well(dare not comment on others make but see it in his workshop too)



And other stuffs I did with him, he will surely honour what he done if after driving yet still don't meet driver's expectation(he will listen thou)
		
		Click to expand...
	


No doubt about his familiarity with Honda models, he knows Honda inside out and of course he will honour what he has done becos the simple reason is his labour is super high and he had profited handsomely no doubt about that therefore he has to honour his words.










	
	
		
		
			For 1 example in term of cost/pricing, I changed all my engine mounting with him, products cost alone as we can easily get from stockist, if not his labour cost is basically reasonable or for this case, almost equal with JB's labour cost as far as I rememebered
		
		Click to expand...
	


Indeed you are talking nonsense again, how can his labour cost equal to those in JB workshops ? Not even a single workshop in Singapore can offer the same or equal to JB current labour cost, totally impossible !










	
	
		
		
			So for my skyhigh pricing experience cost may just be something else which I do believe paying the Right-Man RIGHT(in the of cost) save me much trouble of keep going back to workshop again.

Guess this is why some may still go back to AD as for a peace of mind as they can't find any other workshops to do the job well.
		
		Click to expand...
	


Pls go and do your homework first before talking more nonsense here again, go and check and see yourself how many Honda car owners already abandoned his workshop   ! 










	
	
		
		
			Am not to defeat him as I dont work or get any com from him either but maybe you can share with us what bad experience you recieved from him as to be fair for all here to understand and take note too.
		
		Click to expand...
	


Again that is why I said go and do your homework first, ask around and compare all the prices he quoted then come back to me and talk some sense instead of talking nonsense here trying to defend him !










	
	
		
		
			Lastly, no doubt his service may not be the cheapest but my personal experience .......
		
		Click to expand...
	


Here you go again, one minute you said he is reasonable and now he may not be the cheapest etc......., you are contradicting yourself again and again !








	
	
		
		
			The only downside about skm may be the long Q or wait as usually I will stay throughout the repairing duration.

But now am trusting him more, at times, I will park, let him do it and come back to collect.(this is another reason why I don't do my basic servicing there, too long of a wait but heard it improved but again the pricing does seem skyhigh for me =p )
		
		Click to expand...
	




See, here you go again, ""his pricing does seem skyhigh for me"" !!!

One minute you said he is reasonable, next you said may not be the cheapest and now you said his pricing is skyhigh so in a nutshell his pricing is indeed super skyhigh no doubt about that and why keep contradicting yourself again and again 



Next time drive to his workshop, let him quote and thereafter go other workshop and ask around only then you will know whether he is reasonable, honest or cheap as what you had claimed 



I'll rest my case here, not interested to continue such a stupid discussion !",16-07-16

			Just spotted this post and like to share my 'bad experience' about this Ah WEE (opp KSL).



I bought 3rd party alarm and plan to bring it in JB to get it done (as labour cost is cheaper there thou).



Was there rather early then as wasn't caught in any jam in.

Ah Wee shop open pretty early at 9+am which I think most shop start around/after 10am.



Asked him about the cost of installation as I wanted to do a boot-release with it too(it a given yet optional function).



He quoted me installing of alarm at rm180 and if I need to do the boot function additional rm80.

Total of rm260, which I feel it not cheap at all (almost the price to install in sg thou).

So I politely told him I will think about it and was to leave.

He then, said if I do now he charge rm60 for boot release cost which I still declined and said will think about it.



Went for breakfast and drive around.

asked a 2 other workshops, both quote me rm150.



I do not know how 'good' the workmanship of this AH WEE can be but for sure am not paying for the price quoted(close to SG rate wor)



So be warned when going there to get things done.

If got time to spare, try to compare a few workshops.



Just my 2cents worth for what happened just recently(less than 1 month).

Usually parts are cheaper in Singapore compare to JB but 2nd hand parts will be cheaper there, just ask the JB mechanic and compare both prices.

"Agree on the Singapore workshop. I initially went to one workshop in sg. Few days later noticed the engine temperature is not going up. Went to the same workshop and he say maybe leaking radiator. How can the radiator be leaking when the coolant level never go down and it should be overheating. Quoted me sg400 to do check flush radiator and does not included any repair or parts. 



I checked forums and YouTube only to find out that it might be the thermostat or sensor. Changed the thermostat and all is well. The rm400+ I paid for soo many items in jb is not even half of wat he quoted for dismantle and inspect. Also changed the engine oil after 3k since I didn't trust this fellow already.

Cc5 is MIM. Stated on the wheels itself



Went to swee hing and change my tyres. It's opposite e hawk Tayar at taman sentosa



Tyres r rm220 each for my 195/50 r15. Made in week 48, 2013. Include balancing and wheel alignment. They took my car for a test drive twice. Not sure if that's e usual practice though 



Changed from Bridgestone pontenza tires which was noisy. 



Tyres feel good. (Which new tyres doesn't?) below 40km/h, there's abt 80% reduction in road noise (especially going over those school zone). Going over rough patches in the e'way and I feel the road noise was reduced by abt 50%



Fuel consumption wise, no comments yet. But I felt more inclined to push the accelerator harder coz with new tyres, it just accelerate easier. 



Compared to a set of toyo tyres which I changed for my ex ride, i feel it's almost identical for road noise. Comfort wise, definitely better than my pontenza (already a 3 yr old tyres)



Haven tried in wet condition yet. But for rm220 (sgd88 based on exchange 2.50), I feel it's pretty good



Probably gonna try the Michelin xm2 on my nx ride. Let's c how it goes.",05-07-14

"Just did my servicing and replacement of parts with Jet auto

A Honest and friendly chap i must say, when i met him, he drive my 07 Fit around the place to find out the problem of my car.

We had a chat in the Car, he say that he's with KAH Motor for 6 years, and quit because he find it very xiong to go in and out of custom everyday.

At 1st i abit worry about puting my car in his care while i go do my thing, but he assure me that's its ok, as he will be jacking the car high up, and mention that most of his customer put the car in his ws and went fishing.

So i put the purge and leave the car to him, while he ask his brother to drive me to near by the store to watch movie or do some shopping.



for the price of the service, we had already agreed on the price of things to change in whatapps, his number remain unchange

before commencing on the job when Jet look through my parts, he say an idle valve, i told him i need it to solve my vibration problem, he say dont need, just replace mounting will do.

instead of straight away n go ahead to change and charge me for a fee to do the job, he ask me to ask for refund from the stock list.

here's the list of job i ask him to do



do coolant flush

change gear box oil - i give you my HMMF oil

change 2 behind shock absorber - i give parts

change all engine mounting - parts i provide

Change fan belt - parts i provide

Change Brake oil



Total work took more than 4 hours, and he really give me a very good price, which i feel abit Pai seh also.



And i promise to spread his good words around.

anyway he also have lobang and shares with other WS which do accessories and grooming, if you need any of these, you and go through him and the WS can give you a good price on that. 



before its his shopfront and name card, do make a call before going down, when i was there, there was a oby coming in later, heng i was 1st to reach there so he gg wait for me lol.

"Serviced my CR-V at Jet Cheng workshop for the first time last Sat. 



Whatsapp him at 10am, agreed on price based on my list to change and headed down straight. 



Bought my own parts earlier from local stockist, so had him change my engine oil, oil filter, aircon filter, fix minor power steering pump leak, front brakes service, and radiator coil chemical cleaning. 



Overall very knowledgeable with my car issues from what I can tell (saw only Hondas in his shop btw), friendly service and price charged was very reasonable. 



Will be heading there from now on for my CR-V servicing etc. Need to replace my suspension bushings next and get my alignment done, maybe going next Sat if anyone wanna join me? Just PM

I checked mine before.

Changing engine mount for mine (a Honda too), the labour cost may not be cheaper or just slightly cheaper compare to get it done in SG.

"You may want to try Hypertune JB or one of those performance shops that do aftermarket coilover.



Labour charges in my observation is usually around MYR / SGD 50 per man hour here or in JB WS.



Just did my lower arm suspension bushing change at Jet workshop on Fri, took around 3 hours. Bill for this portion came up to MYR 140 (Parts I supply). 



After that got my front alignment done at Hawk Tayar (near Taman Sentosa), @MYR 37 for computerized front 2 wheels (was also quoted MYR 60 for 4 wheels). They use a new hunter alignment machine and the guy operating it seems quite competent on it. Drove the car before and after alignment to re-check his work. 



Labour intensive repairs in JB definitely more cost effective

"Value for money



I just change my tyres(Primacy 3) and rims from Hup Heng Ang,it's really good value for money.as usual they did a complimentary check for the car.i was shocked that they highlighted that my spark plug needs to be change with less than a week from last servicing at Hanip Auomobile.they showed me the filthy spark plug and carbon flush wasn't being done.i'll be burning money changing my spark plug week in and out as long as the carbon flush not being done.it was really disappointing that i spend over 600 plus at hanip automobile and that's the end product i received.sorry to side track a bit,anyway all the problems was fixed after my last visit to Hup Heng Ang,( brake screeching sound,Side mirror loosen Etc ) that was never even being look into by Hanip automobile.and i would say Hup Heng Ang was really helpful in terms of checking almost every single components of your car,and they would always advise you on the pros and cons of the highlighted parts whether or not you be changing.most importantly seek your approval before changing it and no hard selling.i'll think after the latest visit.i'm more willing than ever now to endure the hours long jam to Jb just to seek their expertise.Hope my review really helps,sorry for the long winded story as i really gets angsty at point of writing.lolx",06-04-15

Check your car 100k service interval chart whether it's a major or minor service so you know roughly.



Get those necessary parts accordingly from your Suzuki stockist (usually oil, cooling, rubber related parts).



Rest of the items get Jet to inspect and replace as necessary, he will advise you.



He should be able to supply those parts you don't have as well, or you can do a 2nd trip to his WS.",19-04-15

"managed to go to JET AUTO.

initial  thought when i saw the place. omg... so rundown. no proper gear... siao liao la.

travel 20mins from KSL to this legendary place, see the garage sian half.



when i reached and park. only a old uncle was there, he was squatting in front of a car spraying i assume chemical into the bonnet area. i asked if i need to wait long for my turn to check on my newold ride, seeing so many japanese car was there. 3SG plates, and even KL plate was there too. perhaps Jet is that good ? Uncles says 45-60mins wait. okay~ i just took my seat as i brought my laptop there to clear some work.



ard 15mins into waiting, old uncle says he's available to check on my car.

a little about my car. i just brought a good looking condition Suzuki Alto, i cant trust what the ex owner say about she had/have maintain and went servicing and etc. so i went on to buy EO,BO,ATF, Filters and etc and brought over to Jet to fix it up.



Jet was very frank and upfront with me, which i fully appreciate, he told me he have not tried fixing my type of car before, but more and less its a JDM. everything should be aga aga the same. so fiixing starts with uncle and jet comes in here and there to help put and advise.



Things done @ Jet Auto

Flush Engine oil + top up with new EO

Flush ATF, top up with new ATF

Flush + Bleed Brake oil, top new BO

De-carb throttle body

chemical wash aircon ""condenser"" or cooler

drain coolant + top up new coolant.



all for 650 ringgit. 



verdict. its all worth it!

car feels smooth and more powerful (butt feel)

gear changing now is not jerky at all~~~ butter smooth!



thumbs up!

Just spotted this post and like to share my 'bad experience' about this Ah WEE (opp KSL).



I bought 3rd party alarm and plan to bring it in JB to get it done (as labour cost is cheaper there thou).



Was there rather early then as wasn't caught in any jam in.

Ah Wee shop open pretty early at 9+am which I think most shop start around/after 10am.



Asked him about the cost of installation as I wanted to do a boot-release with it too(it a given yet optional function).



He quoted me installing of alarm at rm180 and if I need to do the boot function additional rm80.

Total of rm260, which I feel it not cheap at all (almost the price to install in sg thou).

So I politely told him I will think about it and was to leave.

He then, said if I do now he charge rm60 for boot release cost which I still declined and said will think about it.



Went for breakfast and drive around.

asked a 2 other workshops, both quote me rm150.



I do not know how 'good' the workmanship of this AH WEE can be but for sure am not paying for the price quoted(close to SG rate wor)



So be warned when going there to get things done.

If got time to spare, try to compare a few workshops.



Just my 2cents worth for what happened just recently(less than 1 month).",25-11-15

Ya the fact is that, some of them(Malaysia workshops) take advantage of Singaporean's thinking that, we always feel whatever price they offered is 'cheap'....so they just quote a higher price to us(compare to Malaysia or Malaysia do not even go these shops)), thinking that most Singaporean will still bite their bait.



If not, it maybe believe their skills is not there yet, so charged more as they need more time & effort to do it. :/



So whatever the reasons it is, I will rather do it in SG if it not much cheaper ba.

What car are you driving?



I ever enquire about mine.

& I found better deal for it to be done in SG compare to JB wor.

SG workshop offered $120 and think JB workshop offered RM350(the rate was like ~2.8 then).

With the few dollar different, of course I did mine in SG thou.



So imho, it is not always that JB labour cost is cheaper(depend on what is done and which workshops you goes in both Sg & Jb).



But for sure the basis servicing, the labour fee in JB is much cheaper.

Guess he is not your meat/vegetable ba lol.

As believed, one man's meat is another man's poison but not yours. =Ã—



And am saying he is reasonable, not the cheapest thou so pricing everyone should ask around and do your homework what/who workshop/mechanic is worth it?



Hhmmm as for sky high pricing?

For servicing maybe(it's $100+; depend on what EO you chosen) as he have his own EO, etc.



But I usually did my basic servicing; elsewhere as I do BYO stuffs to workshop to get it done at with labour cost( mainly in JB =P )



Otherwise my personal experiences(a couple of times too) was good as in he knows Honda's cars well(dare not comment on others make but see it in his workshop too)



And other stuffs I did with him, he will surely honour what he done if after driving yet still don't meet driver's expectation(he will listen thou)



For 1 example in term of cost/pricing, I changed all my engine mounting with him, products cost alone as we can easily get from stockist, if not his labour cost is basically reasonable or for this case, almost equal with JB's labour cost as far as I rememebered & my aircon system all done by him too was pretty good. 



So for my skyhigh pricing experience cost may just be something else which I do believe paying the Right-Man RIGHT(in the of cost) save me much trouble of keep going back to workshop again.

Guess this is why some may still go back to AD as for a peace of mind as they can't find any other workshops to do the job well.



Am not to defeat him as I dont work or get any com from him either but maybe you can share with us what bad experience you recieved from him as to be fair for all here to understand and take note too.



Lastly, no doubt his service may not be the cheapest but my personal experience with the boss(ah heng) is he is a pretty nice and humble fellow as he does listen to your problem 1st, advice on and see if you want to do it, not like some I went before, do not seem to care much about their customers.



The only downside about skm may be the long Q or wait as usually I will stay throughout the repairing duration.

But now am trusting him more, at times, I will park, let him do it and come back to collect.(this is another reason why I don't do my basic servicing there, too long of a wait but heard it improved but again the pricing does seem skyhigh for me =p )",08-06-16

I would like to share my experience with the same LIAN SENG branch on the 10 June 2016.  Did my engine oil and filter change, tyre balancing, ATF, fuel filter and 2 radiator hose replacement. 



1. Radiator Hose Replacement (1 pair)



During servicing, the tall Chinese mechanic mentioned that the radiator hose was leaking and was quoted RM98 each. Decided to replace both the top and bottom radiator hose.  The following morning, my radiator and engine light came on after 10 mins of driving.  Call up my Singapore mechanic and he advised me to keep topping up the radiator with water in order to limp back to his workshop which is a 10 mins drive away.  My Singapore mechanic did a quick check and found the top radiator hose came loose causing the coolant to leak out.  I suspect that Lian Seng mechanic did not insert the hose and hose clip all the way in resulting in the hose coming loose. My mechanic secure back the hose and hose clip and I just paid for a new can of long life coolant.  A big thumbs up to my Singapore mechanic.



I cannot imagine this to happen while I am stuck in the causeway





2.  Fuel Filter Replacement



My fuel filter is located at the bottom of the back seat . After the replacement, my back seat and tissue box cover which is hanging at the back of my driver seat are all stained with black sealant. My back passengers all got stained black sealant stains on their shorts. I had done this fuel filter replacement thrice at other workshops before and none had messed up the interior like Lian Seng.



In fact there are also other unpleasant incident which I do not want to mention further.  To be fair to them, their prices and service used to be good when they were still new at the KSL area but these incidents are the last straw that I will patronise them again

Prepare to pay tax when you bring it pass custom. What is your tire profile? JB ps3 cost about $70+ for 195/60/15. Singapore cost at least $100. Promo maybe $80+. If you buy your tire from singapore, just change it at Singapore. No point bringing it over.",17-04-17

Ok I will give you all a list of workshop to go to that I used before and they are good.



I work in JB. Running in and out so I need workshop contacts lol.



Those wondering if I open workshop or have a share the answer is no. So thats why I am giving you a list. Also I went to so many before I got my list of workshop. Got carrot before also. so i pay tuition fees but at the end I found these who are good and been using them for 3-7 years no problem. I can leave my car there and walk away, no problems. I go for honest owners only, because the last thing you want is they swap out your engine or your cashcard passport missing. Or tell you this and that spoil must change.



1. If you get into an accident, scrapped the wall or hate the colour of your car how?



Go to:



BTS Painting Workshop

46, Jalan Indah 16/11, Taman Bukit Indah, 81200 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia.



He takes cash only



(It is opposite Tesco near the circle, those who needs direction PM) Otherwise google for Bts Painting Bukit Indah and get the directions from Google



Near BTS there is a workshop called Chiang Auto few door away nia. He specialise in BMWs so BM owners can find him. But he is not cheap just that its cheaper than SG. But Beemer drivers he will give you an accurate diagnosis having done so many cars.



Next up. Jap and Msian made cars this is what you do



1. If you dunno the problem

Go to CH Auto Service (Boss is Michael)



No.122, Jalan Lembah, Taman Tasek Johor Bahru, 80200, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80200, Malaysia



Takes cash mainly, but can try ask him for cc. No Amex no diners





2. Get the diagnosis and if need to change parts walk over to a stockist called 



CK Auto Spares (Stockist takes credit card no amex no diners)

85-87, Jalan Glasiar, Taman Tasek, 80200 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia



And get the parts, walk back to CH auto and give the guy to fix.



But if you already know the problem, buy from Stockist in Sg and bring in to fix.



4) For everything else you are not sure go to

YS Motorsport (Boss is Ah Chen, takes credit card no amex no diners pls)

2G, Jalan Bestari 8/5, Taman Nusa Bestari, 81300, Skudai, Johor, 81200, Malaysia



He does tyre alignment as well, quite cheap, depends on make of car. He drives two generations of 5 series so he is also quite familiar with Beemer. Nowadays alot of Singaporean go there too.. I think they read my post in other forums. There is a prata stall next to the workshop called zam zam which has nice prata.



Toilets is cmi.



Chiang Auto and BTS can walk to Tesco or Jusco but its abit of a walk. The rest no malls nearby. So please kindly download Grab app (thanks to Grab, last time need to sit in workshop for hours and hours... now no need cos got Grab)



If need anything google for the name and get the information before you set off.





Aircon specialist please go to this shop for your aircon problems. Do not go to YS Motor or anyone else that specialises in car engine etc to fix aircon they are not aircon expert, they might be a tad cheaper but whats the point of paying RM500 to these shops and cannot fix the problem and spend more and more money. Unless you know the issue otherwise i advise  against because I paid alot of money before. Tell me compressor I change a whole compressor then found out its fan motor, when my compressor is only 3 year old. No point paying abit cheaper like  rm500 that cannot fix as oppose to RM600-700 to one that can. Top up gas ok, but diagnosis not ok, confirm tell you compressor (everyone else always say compressor cos its convenient no need diagnose and can earn alot) when it could be just a washer etc. The changed for me my aircon coil, clean up everything, added oil to my compressor, which most normal car workshop cannot do. So if they are aircon specialist ask if they can add oil to the car compressor. my aircon is perfect till today still cold when everyone else tells me its compressor. Same for SG, go to car aircon specialist. They know what they talking about.



Syarikat Fuji Car Cooler

15, Jalan Perang, Taman Pelangi, Johor Bahru, 80400, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80400, Malaysia



I paid RM600 for aircon coil + cleaning up + new filter, removal of all aircon gas + re-top up of gas with oil + washing and cleaning of aircon blower (best is ask them not to wash cos sometimes never dry properly can short circuit or spoil. ask them wipe clean) as opposed to RM450 for aircon coil and top up gas.(no oil). Cash only



Up to you guys to decide what you guys wanna do or where to go. Those need anymore info can pm me if I didn't reply here.



Enjoy the weekend

thanks for the detailed listing... i think fuiji car cooler shop is oso the authorized dealer for denso parts... a friend of mine sent his accord there to change cooling coil and stuff too. he said it was way cheaper than doing it in sg.

Thanks YanBros. Mine is 185 / XX/ 14 ( stock suzuki swift). Dont think will be checked by Malaysia custom bah...never stopped by them before. Hmm ok seems like changing tyres and normal servicing is not much cheaper in Malaysia. Say only 25% cheaper ( quite ok but wouldnt make a trip just for it)



Then what is cheaper in malaysia to make it worth a trip just for it? modify car and spray painting? Change number plates? I read the detailed post by laksafan. FOr the things he mentioned, is it worth it to just make a trip for it?



I know for sure wash car ( 10 ringgit includes vacuum), waxing is cheaper in Malaysia but go there do this very lame as come back dirty.



Wheel alignment cost $42 Ringgit ( inclusive of malaysia GST) as i overheard a singaporean paying.

My toyota rush serviced by them second times already, last time $38 all inclusive lub oil fully sync shell helix ultra. So this time $48 add in the ""free"" wiper loh.

clicking sounds from the steering wheel has nothing to do with the steering rack. The clock spring is within the steering wheel itself and when you turn the steering wheel it winds and unwinds itself. On the other hand, if you hear knocking sounds when you are stationary and move the wheel left right, it has to do with the steering rack.",26-04-17

Nowadays almost every car accessories shop does that around RM80, bargain for it cos it's really very competitive.

"Wahhh how to give you a price... We don't work there leh... The price depends on the colour you choose as well.. like you spray back same or different colour etc... You want neon, Matt or rainbow all also have how to give you a price? gotta to bring the car in bro and let the guy quote you, you can choose from the colour chart. Different colour different price... even Nippon paint the same - different colour, type and series different price... Different size different price...



Gotta bring in and enquire and also see the sample and confirm.. if not wait you say baby blue come out sky blue how...



Rims paint and interior paint different from your car paint btw



Best when go JB shop and makan then otw bring to ask lor... Then can ask him if want cheaper which colour can you take etc

			Always ignore the digits in front of the W, it's only meant for countries with winter although some smart Alec will tell you your engine will be freezing cold around minus 5 degrees after leaving it in the car park(Singapore) for 10 hrs.



The other 2 digits are the viscosity ~ layman terms means thickness of the oil. The higher the number the thicker it is.

Manual Clutch & Auto Car Lock 



  

Just when I about to lose hope to find any JB mechanic info, I found HWZ.

 How can HWZ be better than sgcarmart but I was wrong. Just scrolling a few pages and found updated information as recent as last week.



 Please help as I am going to JB tomorrow to service my 9 year old Cerato Kia. Just bought it this month.



 Problem 1 (Clutch)

 Have problem engaging the gear despite stepping the clutch. Reverse gear can feel the spinning of something and the grinding of the metal as I tried to put in reverse gear.



 Read about it and know could be master/slave cylinder, clutch pad, oil leakage, synchros 



 Problem 2 (Car Auto lock)

 The car autolock system just gone crazy and lock unlock and have the rattle sound. Also car lock when key still inside the car. Hence I carry spare key with me always. Just in case.



 I heard LCH & Ah Yuan and something else from laksafan.



 Wont be spending a lot on car as its old and hardly used.

If anyone don't mind please feel free to advise me if there is a better place that I should go, I'll appreciate any advise or recommendation.



Problem: Aircon not cold after stuck in jam for too 20mins and above. Decide to diagnose at the below workshop



Syarikat Fuji Car Cooler



15, Jalan Perang, Taman Pelangi, Johor Bahru, 80400, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80400, Malaysia

+60 7-332 6820



Problem: Speaker wiring seems to have problem. Also deciding whether to do sound proofing depending on the cost.



Sheng auto. 

92, Jalan Bukit Kempas 1/18, Taman Bukit Kempas,

Johor Bahru





Problem: coolant water need to TOP up almost once a week



LCH Brother 

2 Jalan Perkasa 3 Taman Ungku Tun Aminah 81300 Skudai Johor Malaysia



Lastly, I'm looking for a workshop to do re upholster work for my seat, can anyone kindly recommend a good shop please?



I'll be staying there for a few days so no problem Travelling or staying late or whatever. Any recommendation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance !

went LCH for servicing today. Previously, I always did my servicing in SG workshops and authorised dealer.



Pros:

all technicians are well trained

fast servicing

reasonable pricing as mentioned by other bros for servicing

Misc items priced decently (replacement of wiper, rotating, balancing)

I kept asking for rough price before commitment but boss seem to ignore my qn. (fortunately, when the bill came, pricing is reasonable)



Cons:

High tyre camber alignment pricing (60RM for 1 camber nut and labor)

I asked around and also did some research: this camber alignment apparantly is good to have but not tested/required in most normal commercial cars without major accident/dmg. 

Apparantly some other workshops in JB also charge cheaper for this service.



Felt LCH should not have recommended it as it is a ''good to have alignment''. 

However, i still went for it due to many good reviews for them in summary here. And they tell me they cannot align without me purchasing the nut. I did servicing so many years 1st time hear this.",17-07-17

Same experience I got from them about camber nut. But they are not the first ship to recommend this to me.

May i know what car are you driving? I was charged RM65/pc for camber nut. Not upset about price difference, just curious why is there price discrepancy. I'm driving avante by the way. 



I also read that camber nut is actually not needed but almost all workshops across the causeway will offer this because it is easier to rectify/solve issues with the nut.

			Hello all! I'm driving a Swift Sport and I'm planning to renew my car COE and so decided to do the car Swee Swee before I do that. Planning to go in this Thursday to do a lot of things, after seeing all the Bros recommendation, here is the list of things I've gathered. If anyone don't mind please feel free to advise me if there is a better place that I should go, I'll appreciate any advise or recommendation.



Problem: Aircon not cold after stuck in jam for too 20mins and above. Decide to diagnose at the below workshop



Syarikat Fuji Car Cooler



15, Jalan Perang, Taman Pelangi, Johor Bahru, 80400, Johor Bahru, Johor, 80400, Malaysia

+60 7-332 6820



Problem: Speaker wiring seems to have problem. Also deciding whether to do sound proofing depending on the cost.



Sheng auto. 

92, Jalan Bukit Kempas 1/18, Taman Bukit Kempas,

Johor Bahru





Problem: coolant water need to TOP up almost once a week



LCH Brother 

2 Jalan Perkasa 3 Taman Ungku Tun Aminah 81300 Skudai Johor Malaysia



Lastly, I'm looking for a workshop to do re upholster work for my seat, can anyone kindly recommend a good shop please?



I'll be staying there for a few days so no problem Travelling or staying late or whatever. Any recommendation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance !

Call Gosford leather in JB to ask if they can do the roof lining for you and ask hpw long it takes, then you add your toll and time vs what it cost in sg and see if the savings is worth, from what i see sg might  be somewhat cheaper (unless u add groceries savings and cheap food/ massage savings and a little staycation)",09-08-17

Actually I repaired my car in Singapore eventually. Turns out its the fan motor that is spoilt that's why switch on air con to full, go more sound as the fan motor blows more... Not air con compressor.. Heng ah.

I recently bought a 2008 golf gti which is a consignment car from an owner whom is overseas, so I'm not exactly sure what is changed/tuned in the car. But it drives all well, except for the occasional squeak from one of the rear suspension 



So I will to ask if anyone can recommended a workshop in JB who can help to do an overall check on the car and advise whether it makes sense to renew the COE?



And if there is a need to do a full overhaul..a recommended workshop for this type of cars?

My opinion, if installing set not bought from the shop in sg or jb.

Please do ask the fellow to test the set 1st or you show the person it is working on the spot(if possible) BEFOFE installing.



Else installed not working, yes you still need to pay labour costs hor and most likely the worker will said is your set that is not working de.

Change is quite fast. Can be done within an hour. But will need to depend on the crowd as well. YS has its usual crowd, LCR maybe less of a crowd. You can go on the weekends to LCR since you already have your parts. Control arm bush and bearing will need a pneumatic bearing press to push it off the hub/arm. Other than that, no need any other special tool. I have done it at YS before. LCR should have it as well.",03-10-17

 Initially wanted to change at LCH but the EO (5W40) they recommend is ROWE, which is made in Msia I supposed. Anyone has used it EO before ? If not, an alternative is to service at TT motorsport which specialises more on accessories and suspension, or HV racing. I have not been to HV racing though

Just curious, why not get your own EO and supply to LCH? If you aren't fussy about which group the oil is, Shell Helix Ultra 5W40 fully synthetic goes for S$35 for 4L. LCH to BTS side is also only like 5KM, Uber like few RM.

Actually can also. Other than shell, should I get other brands like motul or Pennzoil, where you guys usually get these from? I only know mxtrading. 



Side track a bit, other than relying on Wi-Fi, I don't have data plan in msia. Usually how you guys access to data? Buy a SIM card there? My frequency to msia is only once every 3 weeks nia so usage is really low that's why never think of uber to aeon from LCH

A full syn idemitsu already cost RM200+ on the internet market in Malaysia. You could be getting semi syn oil that costs around RM130 + filter + labour + mark up profit = RM255



It could be worse - they gave you mineral oil which is around RM88

Nice......i know bukit indah beside tesco and Giant that space has alot of workshops.



I went one random workshop to get my audio wiring and in car wiring fixed. Remember it's beside a laundry shop at the corner of that workshop cluster.



As my car was bought 2nd hand and renewed.....alot of old wiring left like foglight/DRL, car alarm leftover wires.



The shop took some time and removed almost 10m worth of unknown cables and properly wired up car camera and defi to my steering main power source instead of fuse box.



Now below steering looks very much cleaner and no worries of wires dropping down or short circuit.



Spent rm180 for all works and 3 hours of removing every cable, identifying them and cable management.



Spent my time waiting and observing there as I wanted to know what are the wires left inside.",28-12-17

Condensation is not normal - it's bcos they didn't use NEW silicon specifically meant for headlamp(acrylic), they normally reuse back the old silicon which can no longer seal the headlamp tight.



There is no workshop in sg that can do a good job on your headlamps/tail lamps.



I even went all the way to KL to mod/repair my headlamps.



You can go to Sheng auto to do also. They did quite a lot of headlamp repairs and modding.



 I didn't let them do cos I prefer a headlamp specialist (one and only in whole south East Asia)

 He did asked me to try, no effect can take out and refund. 



I roughly know what's this but haven't installed. Quite similar to Firestorm



Basically it's an ignition coil booster that will boost your ignition coil voltage from 12v to 16-18v, allowing ""better"" combustion thus getting a boost in power. FC wise i don't think it will improve but likely you may feel more response in your throttle.



Can't comment if it will overload your ignition coil or wear out your spark plugs faster, but feedback from them is that it works with all models and no issues with it so far.",11-01-18

is it the clicking sound described on the other thread? reverse, brake, click? forward, brake, click? if it's so... seems like your pads are moving slightly.

Iâ€™m not sure whether the pads have been greased. 



Yes I have this clicking sound whenever I reverse-brake, forward-brake and even when stopping at traffic light-brake. What I read from the Lexus forum is that the brake pads have a free play movement causing the sound.

maybe while turning it's going back and forth thus the continuous clicking sound, hopefully it's that.. but could the rotor be loose?  hope that's not the case.



perhaps you can let the workshop know that the brake pad is running loose and not secured then see what they can do about it? no harm doing a brake servicing to clear off the brake dust as well.",19-01-18

"i have a problem.. few weeks ago, the oil pressure warning light(Aladdin lamp) starts to flicker during idling(once i stopped the car after parking). i quickly switch off the engine and on again and the flickering stops. everything back to normal.



few days ago, the flickering of oil pressure warning light came back when i started my car(car was used less than 30mins ago, so eliminating low temperature cause). switch off and check engine oil level - at the correct level. switch on the engine again and it still flickers. dont know why but i decided to step on the accelerator abit to rev the engine and the flickering stops.



the flickering came on more and more often but always disappear when i rev or the car is moving, meaning,  the flickering comes when the engine is idle.



anyone know whats the probable cause? Is this issue critical or just sensor heywire and i can continue to drive and live with it till next servicing?



Does LCH carries OBD2 (On-board-diagnostics) ? I'm thinking of going back to them to let them check because i just did my servicing from them in late Dec. Or you guys think i should settle it in Singapore?

check ur dipstick properly to see if oil level is low... check the level in the morning b4 u start the engine and check again after u start the engine for 10 to 15 mintues. if the level is below or at the low indicator, top up the eo accordingly. could be an oil leak somewhere.

I tried my luck at BTS Bukit Indah today and surprised the boss Mr Bon knows how to fix it. Not only he fix the sliding door, he also pointed to me the front passenger door also not being able to closed properly. He rectified all my doors. Charged me only RM150

Engine mountings usually are from Japan. The difference not much even if you buy in sg.

Absorbers - When it's fails, you will feel the bumpiness of the road

Springs - Idk but mine have some creaking sound when someone alights from the rear 

Spring Stiffeners - You're just gonna make the ride even more bumpier 

Lower Control Arms - Usually you don't have to change the whole control arm but just the lower arm bush.

Check with LTA on the Philips bulbs.

No issues so far, I don't monitor my ATF temps but I can feel that the transmission is more responsive perhaps due to the lower temps.

Once you find the part, you need to chat with the seller. Now due to CNY most already holiday mood.



1&2 might be the difference between normal and long wheel base.

After much persuasion and with my assurance that anything wrong with the vinyl i would not hold them responsible, then the guy just did light polishing.

If you can feel your car sort ""fishtailing"" at turns then yes with the rear bar can really feel a huge difference.

Speaker/audio is Sheng Auto- +60167035250

If you want for short term you can buy used speakers off Carousell or what(make sure you know your speaker size) and ask them to do installation for you or ask them if they have anything used/cheap and say your car only left 2.5yrs.

No worries bro.  Hmmm, you can ask Sheng auto what cams they have and how much all in.

Usually paint touchups are not economical because they will quote based on the spray paint area. 1 area = x price, 3 areas = 3 x price. By then you might as well respray the whole car.

You want real cheap - giant and Mr DIY. But cut yourself.



Sheng auto - whole car should be less than RM200. Go for the thin ones, the thick ones trap dirt but difficult to remove.

			I've read online that camber nut is not necessary and not critical item. But it is a common practice in alot of JB workshops. I think the nut is just to convenient them to align your tyres.



 Then again, since the stock is not adjustable, you may end up spending more to replace other parts so that your alignment is straight. So maybe this camber nut is a cheaper alternative to making your alignment straight



 You say their price is good but the quotation you stated is LCH charges more for engine mount compared to Singapore workshop?

Perhaps you should let us know if you're doing just oil change or major servicing? Your current vehicle mileage? 



If it's just oil change, you can do it in Singapore at low prices as well!

1. Toyota Engine Oil 5W30

2. Oil Filter (Optional, WS provides them too.)

Uber doesn't check your vehicle condition.



Although U/G seems like a convenient way to earn quick money and also the low startup/running cost since you already have a vehicle, do consider the following:



1. Conversion to Z10/Z11 - $100

2. Commercial Insurance - $1xxx per year

3. Maintenance (More KM runs thus more servicing) - $50+ onwards per 10k km + wear & tear parts replacement

4. Risks - High excess, do drive safe!

5. Incentives - Driver's earnings are supported by incentives, only if you have time to drive then you will be able to achieve their weekly incentives. U/G fares alone can kill your motivation to drive (Just imagine that you have to drive 5km for a $5 trip with many many traffic light stops and then get a 20% commission cut off the final fare - $4, and you don't qualify for any incentive for that week)



Sounds like a high risks, low returns activity.

The worker was still telling his boss how he charge me $95 per piece for a 2nd hand window switch I got 2 and laughing there. Bad bad experience will never ever step into that shop. Quoted me with gst and refuse to issue me receipt when payment for labour and insisted I had to pay gst if want receipt. Double gst lol!!! What a joke workshop I said no I need the receipt and I repeated multiple times that the worker quote me with gst and they angrily printed out with a black face (lady boss).

			Now at LCH. 6 months ago when I first took over this car, I went to LCH to change my tyres, and was told to change my brake pads during my next servicing. During the replacement today, my existing pads are still in good condition but nevertheless, proceeded with the change and didn't probe furrher as the cost of the pads + servicing are still negligible. A bit disappointed though. I brought my own EO, pads, Spark plug, and oil filter. Breakdown as followed (in RM) 

1. Change spark plug 100

2. Change pads 150

3. Change EO and filter 25

4. Change ATF (yet to ask)

Be careful with large car parts like radiator, shocks, coils etc. When going through Malaysia customs take the green channel/lane(far/first left and far/first right lane*applies to Woodlands, I don't take Tuas much* after the passport stamp/toll payment booth. If you go through the other red lanes, they see these things the boleh polis may try to squeeze some cash from you, can be % value of the item or 50RM.

For radiator I would usually get it from the workshop - at least if there is any leaks, they will have to change it. The savings is not much to warrant such a risk.

Rotors n brake pads non mechanical as in no moving parts inside. It's just a piece of round shape alloy so I am ok with it. Already using close to a year. Ceramic Brake pads I bought mid range type, so so but can do the job. Strut bars they copied Cusco and the quality is as good as Cusco.

you don't know what kind of material they use to make the rotor. your disc rotor go thru a lot heat cycle. poorly made disc are prone thermal cracking which could cause catastrophic failure.

Is it like a scrape type of noise, like metal, that only lasts like 0.5-1 second after you crank? Does it only happen the first time you start the engine in a day(cold start)? If you've already driven your car like about 15mins or more and turn it off, then crank again while the car is warmed up, does it still happen?



Oh and when doing cold start, try to turn the key to ACC first, don't crank, wait about 15-20 seconds then crank, still has the noise?",14-04-18

It's most likely starter motor issue. How old is your car and how many KMs? How long to COE expiry? If still a number of years, best to replace the starter motor before it totally fails and you need a tow. If not long to COE expiry, can try checking with LCH Bros if they can lubricate the starter motor for you. Have to just open up the starter and lubricate the drive gear(pinion) and the shaft and check if the bushing or other parts are worn.",14-04-18

			What happened? Care to share your experience bro?

My personal alternate for LCH Bros is this shop called TS Motor Workshop Services

58, Jalan Setia Tropika 1/7, Taman Setia Tropika , 81200 Johor Bahru, Johor

+60 16-762 3240

+60 12 465 1618 (Xiao Ming, ex-BMS mechanic)



Very reasonable prices and they know their stuff. Trustworthy and honest shop. If you go, can tell them the Singapore black civic guy that used to go to them recommend you. My car scrap liao.

If you buy from soon lee, price is inclusive of installation or sometime just add $20-30.



If you buy from elsewhere like Mustafa or online and ask soon lee to install minimum is at least SGD$60-80.

Jet is very very knowledgeable about anything Honda. His prices have gotten quite steep though. I'd only go to him for complicated/hard to diagnose issues. General overhauls and straight forward work etc there's always my usual go to, TS at Setia Tropika and LCH Bros. 



No need to see a senior consultant for a flu, polyclinic GP can liao.  



I'd also buy the parts they quote high for in SG if I want to save some cash. Some things JB quite ex, also depending on workshop, like engine oil. Your quote for the iridium plugs also very ex, can get a lot cheaper here. I got a set of Denso Iridium for S$37 a few months back. Most things are negligible though.

My personal alternate for LCH Bros is this shop called TS Motor Workshop Services

58, Jalan Setia Tropika 1/7, Taman Setia Tropika , 81200 Johor Bahru, Johor

+60 16-762 3240

+60 12 465 1618 (Xiao Ming, ex-BMS mechanic)



Very reasonable prices and they know their stuff. Trustworthy and honest shop. If you go, can tell them the Singapore black civic guy that used to go to them recommend you. My car scrap liao.

			Well i did my servicing here in singapore. And i was shocked at the price difference that 'jet cheng' charged me. In all honesty he is definitely good but i was way way overcharged for his servicing. Its almost more expensive that the singapore ws charged me for basic servicing. Well we live and learn..
		
		Click to expand...
	


Basic servicing maybe should just do in Singapore, for my case, i engaged Jet after visiting 3 different workshops in SG to settle my suspension + shock absorber + engine mount problems which still exists until I went to his shop at Tun Aminah.



I would say his troubleshooting skills are on the expert level and he will test drive around after every fix he did ( which I don't see any workshops in SG do....., at least from my own experience) 



Price wise he's still cheaper to what SG workshops quoted me (30% less) with new parts rather than 2nd hand parts in SG....



Basic servicing I will just go to shell or SPC service stations for a quickie lol",01-06-18

His workshop is small though, but luckily I was first to arrive. Canâ€™t tell about workmanship/skills yet as my problem was quite straightforward. 



Overall good experience. Price on par with LCH. Have asked him to look out for several parts for my car, will go back again if quote is right.

Sorry to say I trust no one in malaysia and it is not their responsiblilty to keep your car safe(imo).



If really kanna stolen, guess they will just apology to you and that's it.

Dont think we Singaporeans there can expected or demanded anything more ba.

Or can we ask them to compensate a car back or anything back in singapore's value?



If you try making police report against them, well it may not make thing easier or to your favour i guess(hope am wrong but never wish to try this.)



Yet again if it gone in malaysia, will stil a must for police report to file for your own insurance claim/report.



Hence like many will suggest:

Be safe than they saying sorry to you and that's it.........



That's my take.

Want it cheap goto waste the time.

Want it safer, do in Singapore I guess.

			good or not subject to your ear. I feel its good enough for me, as i have a bad encounter at SG, and i feel they tune much better then the SG 1..



There might be better tuning out there.. but price wise much better at there.



Soundproof all they do, they always have some funny brand speaker but sound wise i will say quite good as i listen to their demo set before..



To add on they have some funny brand DSP which cost a fraction of the branded one in SG yet can do same function or better.

"Do not go LCH for accessories or solar film... if you need to change engine, engine oil, tyres, gearbox or its oil, suspension, battery, alignment etc you can go to him hahaha



Personally my experience with solar film in jb hasn't been great, my experience is that some of them can't cut to size properly and alot of bubbles as well as zero or very insignificant heat rejection, some can do great job but the heat rejection is very poor at best 20-40%. they are good for tinting though from my experience. tinting most of the time have low heat rejection, and they can be very cheap cos its only dark film and if you request that your car not be so hot they will give u super dark one which confirm fail by lta but from what i experienced in my friend's Msian car its also hot... at the end of the day i do it in Sg (which is done by Msians too). There were two really good solar film shops in jb which has closed down and they were not exactly cheap either but maybe thats why they have closed down. As brother snipfer has suggested Stealth is actually good. Actually just yesterday two of my friend recommended me two solar film places to try cos i wanna change out my existing film from my new car... supposedly 3M not sure if its fake cos its hot like hell... I haven't gone yet maybe later in July

			I went to LCH brothers for the first time recently to do wheel alignment (RM35) and tighten my handbrake (RM30). 



Thought their attitude was so-so only. Wheel alignment was pretty okay but the handbrake was over-tightened by their young staffs (the boss-like guy, whom I assume is Ah yuan was just popping by occasionally to check). 



Ended up that once I left the shop and drove over a patch of rough roads, my car shook so violently that initially I thought I blew a gasket or timing belt. Suspecting that it was a jammed brake, I went back to LCH to rectify. Another more senior dude came to check and was a little defensive - like how could a tightened handbrake cause violent shaking. Anw we got it loosened again and the car was good to go.   



Are they really the cheapest? How about Hawk taya and the other LCH shop? If they are the cheapest then I have no complains

Based on the shops intro here. 



I compare lch and ts motor for servicing the below. 



- change eo

- change coolant 

- change brake fluid 

- change power steering fluid 



Labour fees as below 



LCH - 65RM 

TS MOTOR - 120RM



There might be cheaper ones but need some luck to try out. 

Maybe can test water by doing alightment and balancing at other ws. 





My first time visit LCH, it was ah yuan himself settle my car for me and his 2nd 3rd man never come over at all. 



But after subsequent visit , I realised ah yuan willl not touch my car anymore and will send his 2nd and 3rd man only. 



At times ah yuan will just come over look see but never bother much. 



Think I will go Bukit indah area near bts paintshop to try out one of the ws service. 



KSL area ws I don't dare to go in, I feel quite dangerous and expensive.

in that case it seems LCH is still the go to shop for value-for-money. 



previously my wheel alignment issue arose cos I changed both front tyres (Goodyear with cracked sidewalls) at another shop in Taman Johor Raya. the service was not bad, they covered the seat and steering wheel and I got used Michelin ps3 for 100rm a piece. didn't head back for wheel alignment as it was a little out of place.

2nd day after changing tyres - 1 valve was leaking so badly I had to visit AL tyres at 9pm. After that I found 2 more tyres were leaking, got pissed and go to ah yuan to have all the valves changed to steel valves.

but when i drove pass never saw when on the way to this WS called Korea A..



korea A is the same stretch with motosport based on maps.



saw so many car when i was there.




	





once reached, park my car and told them i am here to check my car to diagnose for any issue as I feel car jerking a times. contact them thru fb before heading down.



the boss came out and he proceed to check my car using a spacial tablet..

he say will check for misfire and etc like sensor error and everything.

took 10mins.. then told me no error at all.



in fb he told me 50RM for check, wanted to pay him but he say no need.

ask if his shop do balancing and alignment he say his shop no machine to do ask me go one nearby his shop to do. I say okay.



once again, this ws I feel quite good, thou busy with many car still entertain me. will shortlist this WS for troubleshooting of car issues in future.



my car jerking issues was caused by an OBD meter as i just remove it on last Thursday before i go to this WS. but i still go just for a peace of mind.

proceeded to the this WS for balancing and alignment as this was just nearby.




	





drove in told the Chinese guy what I wanted.. ask him how much..told me 72 RM all in. Pass him key then he drove in for me.



1st was balancing, took out all my 4 tires and proceeded as per normal.

total 1 Chinese guy and 2 many guy working on it. 



while waiting chat with the Chinese guy.. how much for labour EO, and ATF all I bring.he quote me 60RM all in for labour.



once balancing completed, they put back my tires and help me to add air for my tires without even me saying anything, took initiative as i did not say anything while watching them.



while putting air, told me why my tires pump so much air??? 300 Kpa and how me guage.. I say the last time i pump was 2 weeks ago at another WS in jb (LCH brother)



he comment, 300Kpa is to much and tire will spoil very fast.

plus don't i feel when driving when bumpy ???



i say ya abit leh.. he proceeded to adjust for me to 230Kpa..



once done.. he drove my car for me to alignment spot.

using hunter alignment machine.. once align , he drove my car out to test drive while i wait at the shop. took 5 mins before he back..



once back drove back to alignment again.. then he went to test drive it again.



5 mins then back again, told me all done boss and pass me key..



very satisfied and pay the shop cashier, a lady malay girl.

upon looking at the receipt..they do provide other service of car..



while about to left saw one more guy came back wearing the same uniform as them..look like shop of the boss as he was sitting outside and just looking at them doing work. waved at me when i drove off..



overall, quite impressed with this WS on just simple balancing and alignment.

thanks to them for informing my tire was over pump by LCH at 300kpa.



sadly, think will be my last time going LCH already after knowing about this

.

usually i don't pump air myself..always go WS do but I trusted LCH guys of knowing the basic but sadly it was not..

You must see what car you driving. Also must take note they left hand drive so some part not fit plus there is always a risk the part might be fake? But to me so far the parts look real but even if fake, they really make effort to make it like real parts. What attract to me is the price. 1 bushing before shipping is like from 5-10 SGD before shipping",10-08-18

This new workshop location is secluded. Zero walk in customers.



Ah yuan's pricing has always been economical unlike some chop carrot shops see sg plate different price. Moreover I like how the way he do things - never had to worry.



Usually legit workshops will not quote a higher price waiting for you to bargain. It's those chop carrot shops that does that. What they quote are usually very competitive to  other workshops near them.

No longer can top up at JB Custom since last month if you via woodlands. I heard there is a self service top up machine at Tuas custom before you leave sg.

 

T&G card can be top up at major supermarket in JB. Jusco, Big Giant outlets. No admin fee.

Small admin fee applicable if you top up at petrol stn in JB.



Alternatively, you can subscribe to be Watson member. The member card is a T&G. Annual member fee is RM20 if i rem correctly. 



You can try requesting a top up with the normal T&G card at Watson. I went to few Watson outlets, some outlets ok to top up for normal T&G, but some rejected.

U can view front and back collision also. 



Inside the app the videos collected with be dump to different folder. 



Driving - once engine start

Park - parking time when engine off.

Autofun and dratex materials for each application ...ie sound proofing or for vibration absorb at its best. These two brands are popular. SG workshop also uses these two brands commonly. Another brand- Dr Silent. 



Search for AudioLution in FB, 4 doors, 2 layers each door all in at RM388. Using 3M material. You gauge yourself and check if this promo still on.

Hmmm I'm not 100% certain about this because normally people tow FROM JB back to SG. In that case from what I recall you have to engage a Malaysian tow truck to bring it to SG and they either hand over at Woodlands or at the causeway to the SG tow truck. 



If the repair price difference is significant and it's possible to tow a car from SG to JB, you can consider. 

WhatsApp Ah Yuan and any other mechanic in this list(if you want a comparison quote). If they quote you like RM2000 and the tow works out to say S$200/RM600, you'll still save over S$500. Of course you need to adjust to the actual numbers you get to see if it's worth it. 



Also, check local workshops for quotes. I don't use too many of those so can't advise too well but can try this one for a quote(I only went there once for servicing and the guy seemed good, no hardselling nonsense and knew his work)-

https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/15NoGP5I_sk1SQD-0QKdo2kz2oyY8Gen9O5uDB1HHtpw/edit



Oh ya, there's actually quite a bit of anecdotal evidence of products like head gasket stop leak working. You can ask Ah Yuan what he thinks about that.

"If you really want to hiong, then go in at like 2am when there's very little chance of jam and you can drive slowly, then spend $40-50 to sleep at a simple boutique hotel in Sutera area so that you can go to carclick easily. There's a few budget ones around that area as well. But I really do think this type better to do locally.

Lol.... Nice one...



Got my first ride last year. Went JB workshop near KSL. Shop name also Ah Wee.....  Now a few shops also called Ah Wee. 

Change air-con filter. Ok lor.. change.



Subsequently, due for EO change, went to frd's introduced workshop in Permas Jaya, this time bgt own air con filter. The technician there tell me, boss your old filter in car was installed opposite... i was like huh!!!



BTW, my ride is a boleh land brand.

			Just spotted this post and like to share my 'bad experience' about this Ah WEE (opp KSL).



I bought 3rd party alarm and plan to bring it in JB to get it done (as labour cost is cheaper there thou).



Was there rather early then as wasn't caught in any jam in.

Ah Wee shop open pretty early at 9+am which I think most shop start around/after 10am.



Asked him about the cost of installation as I wanted to do a boot-release with it too(it a given yet optional function).



He quoted me installing of alarm at rm180 and if I need to do the boot function additional rm80.

Total of rm260, which I feel it not cheap at all (almost the price to install in sg thou).

So I politely told him I will think about it and was to leave.

He then, said if I do now he charge rm60 for boot release cost which I still declined and said will think about it.



Went for breakfast and drive around.

asked a 2 other workshops, both quote me rm150.



I do not know how 'good' the workmanship of this AH WEE can be but for sure am not paying for the price quoted(close to SG rate wor)



So be warned when going there to get things done.

If got time to spare, try to compare a few workshops.



Just my 2cents worth for what happened just recently(less than 1 month).

23, Jalan Permas 9/9, Bandar Permas Jaya, 81750 Masai, Johor.

Contact Ah Chen @ +6012-794 2588.



EO and filter bring yourself. Labour is RM 30 or RM 40. Can't rem as i don't ask for receipt. Unless is big ticket items. 

Thats for boleh land car and i assumed Jap or kimich rides, labour should be around there.



For conti servicing, labour cost you need to call him. i did see cars came in for normal EO change and other mechanical parts change. This shop carries Lucas oil.

Hi guys I bought a second hand car abt 2 and a half months ago and now Iâ€™m having some trouble with it. According to the mechanic who they asked me to go to keep the warranty he said that my cars piston lining is gone and we have to overhaul the enegine. And I asked the dealer wether it can be done and he replied me saying that itâ€™s only for gear box that he gave warrenty but then I remember him telling me so clearly that enegine is included too. According to the black and white itâ€™s not stated that he cannot do the engine but he is trying to make me bare the cost. I only got this car for 2months plus and Iâ€™m afraid I will lose out in this matter. Pls advise me on this and thank you so much,14-11-18

Is very unfortunate that another victim fall into this situation. Like brothers said here, DO NOT BELIEVED ANY USED CAR DEALER, WHAT THEY SAID BEFORE SALES STARTS, ASK THEM WRITE ON THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT. AND WORKSHOPS THEY RECOMMEND YOU. 

Instead of ting -tong here and there, seek CASE for help first. Get some advice from them then proceed the next step. At least they can bridge between you and dealer when coming to ""lemon law""

Unless your pocket is deep enough you can go straight to law firm and file a case.",14-11-18

Rm180 is only SGD$60, don't think even China tyres can get at SGD$60.



16"" at RM270 is cheap, my last set of Michelin XM2 16"" high profile is around RM340

The standard really varies significantly from one car wash shop to another. Been there done that. There are some that only specialise in car wash like those around JB kastam. Detailing is only an add-on service. On the other hand, there are those detailers/groomers whose main business is detailing.



Do your own dilligence first before letting car wash shop wax/polish your ride. Been there done that. My paintwork was screwed up by a car wash shop in SG. Had to send for paint correction after that.",16-11-18

Price on Amaron battery looks good man. Did you get quotes from ah yuan and da sen etc also? How did they compare? 



I think Legends at B.Point does an OK job but their quality depends on which guys are working that day and how many cars they need to clear. Busy time not as good. Can consider those detailer shops like D'lux or Posh. A bit more ex like rm14 or 15 if I'm not wrong but can tell them to focus more on the interior vac part.

I don't know why people have a preference for the HK Shell..I've alternated between both and there's no difference..at one point Giant in SG was selling both the Europe and HK one, HK one more stock so I'd picked up a few of each. I believe this stems from some marketing spin by Shell to push people to buy from their petrol stations and to prefer the 'local' variant. They also told people not to buy from Lazada and Shopee and other platforms in Malaysia, a lot of fakes which is apparently true there.



 Either I'm not looking hard enough or not in the right places but I haven't found any actual technical fact sheets that show a difference in the oils based on country of mfg.



The Bosch I think I saw on the catalogue got fully syn eo also for a bit more than the semi.

When buying off Carousell etc. for speakers also need to be careful, read a lot about fakes that look pretty much identical unless you put a real/fake set side by side and compare the wires etc. A lot of people online report they got their Hertz fakes from Malaysia..not sure if made there or Malaysia sellers bringing in the China fakes, probably the latter.",21-11-18

I got mine used set via carousel. You need to verify tread depth before installation. 

I asked a few in JB recently for my size but no luck. 

You can try:

1. BC Tyres & Sports Rim. This one quite far from JB. +6018782 0199. 

2. NYK Auto Service- JB. +6016786 6083

3. Tyre Mart Service Center. +6010535 4720

15/16 size, need to know which brand then check around. If brand not important, JB should be cheaper.

Used tyres are fine, just know the things to lookout for-

No older than 5 years

Check the rubber thoroughly to ensure no cracks are forming, the sidewall is proper etc. Got guides online how to inspect a used tyre.



It isn't an issue. Just match the tyre on each axle. Don't front left one type front right another type..although some people(including me ) have used different tyres also and your car won't explode la bro but supposedly may affect handling or something..there was no significant difference for me..ymmv  The general advice is, and I still prefer to match the same tyre for each axle..where possible.

Just take the green channel, far left and far right lane depending on which counter you clear..they very rarely check there, of course best also to unseal the engine oil bottle so even if they check can just say your engine leaks and it's for top up and drive.

			Yeh, it's the typical chop carrot shop modus operandi..they see SG plate or number etc and they mark down what it costs to do it in SG by 10-20% and quote. So many people in SG first time doing work there and some even repeat will think the 10-20% is a good enough deal/savings. If ah yuan can do will be really good. Can see  what the job really costs there.

Although some guys here got a good price on the MC6 from NYK. Have you checked them for a quote? I checked them for PS4 but price from LCH Batteries still the best.

My COE Mazda 323 aircon has on and off hissing sound. 

Read in this forum recommended JB ac shops are Sheng Auto

& Sykt Fuji Car Cooler.The posts I saw were sometime in 2017.

Are these shops still there, and still reliable?

Have been down on luck so need to watch expenses.

Thanks for your kind input.

My boleh land car ac was not cold enough during jam and  afternoon drive. Went to Sykt Fuhi Car Cooler. 

They did everything right and professionally but did not managed to solve my ac not cold. Maybe am unlucky.



Then went to Sheng Auto to get a 2nd opinion.... Jackson solved it. 



Sykt Fiji is like 5mins away from JB custom while Sheng Auto is a distance away from JB custom and recommend to make a booking with Jackson before going.

Nope.... All items in the system is ok. Jackson informed that this is common problem for my ride. Design problem in fact. Was surprised that God of aircon did not mentioned to me on this. 

Jackson uses layman method to direct air flow from outside to the condenser thus better heat dissipation.  Been 1 year and good till recently i returned to him for a leakage at the condenser.

As mentioned in my earlier post, my ride has this hissing sound when on a/c. Then diagnosed is leakage at condenser. 

Nevertheless, either Sheng Auto or God of aircon will hook up the gauge to confirm leakage or not. Their usual protocol.

Wah, bit of an uphill task since there's a lot to cover..

Basically, it drives very nicely at highway speeds and off the mark has enough pull for overtaking easily. Body roll is significant when cornering at speed, obviously.



Fuel consumption is killer, especially since it's 9yrs old now. I've heard the 2.0L variant is better but I felt it would be too underpowered for a car this size. I get around 8-9km/l averaged out 60/40 city/highway and this is when I'm driving super relax, trying to cruise control and coast as much as possible to save fuel. Only once in a while drive a little faster but not for long.



Comfort is there. It's massive, and cushioned. Very nice to sit in, would make a great family car for road trips etc. Reliability is also ok. Has some electrics but they didn't go way overboard with it so still ok. My suspension may be wearing out though. Hear an odd thunk once in a while.. 



Let me know if you were curious about anything specifically.

I haven't personally driven the equivalent Camry...at least not in many years.. Though some reviews I read, people say the Camry feels more antiquated. Toyota seems to like to stick to the script and isn't the most innovative in that sense. Lacks modernity. Not sure about current gen Camry though. The Teana front passenger seat actually has an electric footrest that can raise and lower, like a recliner chair, and the seat can go almost flat  but my car the footrest motor is spoilt and I'm not paying to have it fixed  Found that a nice touch, if it worked.



For the 180bhp have to take the 2.5L fc  Worth it...I guess..I think 2L puts out abut 10km/l. Teana/Cefiro is actually just a badge thing..they're sold as Teana/Cefiro/Maxima depending on the market and same platform as the Altima. Cosmetic and some other differences. 



For SG market the J31(03-08) and older was called Cefiro then the J32 and current model ones were called Teana. Sadly these cars are dying out thanks to petrol prices, road tax, emissions concerns and people just going for smaller, more A to B cars like the Sylphy.",26-12-18

Driven a rented 2.0L for Melaka-JB trip, definitely comfortable and not underpowered on the NSHW. FC is close I believe, due to its weight. Stable cruise at high speed and pickup is decent.

It's the officers randomly walking around outside after the passport clearance, before and after secondary clearance, I noticed some were looking  The ICA lady in the booth check passport didn't ask for my no. plate like they sometimes do if the camera not clear or car out of frame, just a big smile  I also smile back la  Hope no one kachau la, I know ICA can't care less but TP are a different story.. 



Ty sir, am loving it  my stock plate was damaged also, like some clown knock then another clown take out, use hammer and knock back straight  was annoying me daily 



I was thinking of initially getting the 2L but I saw the power was the same or similar to my FD1 Civic and considering the body, I thought it could do with some extra pull.  I'll probably do a trip up to KL, put it through its paces before my COE expires. 



I was looking at stability bars actually, found some shops in Malaysia that do but a lot are in KL so have to ship it down, a bit lachey. Car also only left 9 months, decided if I find someone who's selling dekit used strut bars, I'll grab it, otherwise I'll stick to limiting my cornering since I've already established the limits of the car stock lol

I might get the 3d chrome one for my next car..if have(in sg )

I want to have a wide variety of plates, my aus one I liked the most but the Lightrix one is competing firmly..Aus one is custom plate, black background, red numbers. I like black and red combi... a lot 

Although I do like this plate, it's a running 3,4,5 with an extra 0 in the middle 

NA Foresters are good  can go.. the turbo one good chance on the way or on the way back, it'd have become an NA  Last time my friend's Skyline went for a roadtrip a turbo Skyline and returned naturally aspirated..

Thanks  I've always liked large sedans..my last car in Aus was also a large sedan although I had a lot more potential choices..just a lot more powerful  It does have nice pull at the right rev ranges and the cvt just makes it go

			3 fingers is good. Only down side to lowering springs is that you won't be able to adjust the damping rate, so you gotta go really slow at humps. If it's not good enough, you can add in those spring cushion buffer... although not really recommended 



Wah CarClick is already the fastest workshop liao!  My wife don't like me to go Sheng Auto cuz take very long, but she's ok with CarClick

I now stock spring usually very slow over hump also. So used to it Liao. 

The spring buffer a lot people put last time. 



Last heard abit like snake oil. Best to avoid



My Wife dun like Sheng auto. Say worker slow and talk cock a lot. 

She also say during night time there like dangerous and unsafe.

With that being said, last I went to Ah Yuan at LCH Bros for flush, I don't think they have the machine to do a fluid flush thus its a fluid change that I've done. Not sure if they can do it at CarClick now though.

A lot of my price comparisons are from when Ah Yuan was at LCH Bros so not sure if still the same but I find sometimes his stockist prices for certain parts(OEM also) can be a bit more. 



My rear wheel bearing Ah Yuan quoted was RM380 genuine/RM280 OEM/RM60 labour if part provided. I got done at my alternate workshop that I find equal quality and skill, TS Motor, as their quote was RM330 genuine/RM230 OEM/RM60 labour if part provided. RM50 not very much when converted to SGD but it's a third of my petrol tank refilled there.

So am I right to say if you don't bring your own parts, ah yuan can be more ex? That reasonable as JB parts usually more ex then at due to their taxes if I not wrong.

Some parts, yes. I tend to supply part unless really need on the spot or low cost part or just go to my alt shop which has cheaper parts generally. Yeh, the labour is very competitively priced. Taobao can get really good deals but must know how to spot. Sometimes I buy parts from KL or other parts of MY also if can get cheap then mail it.

Ususally I do a multipronged search. The usual MY sites like Carousell/Gumtree where people/companies list like: https://www.lelong.com.my/

https://www.mudah.my/

Then the MY version sites of Shopee and Lazada etc. :

https://shopee.com.my/

https://www.lazada.com.my/

Then google generally with keywords like malaysia, selangor, johor, etc. and find shop contacts as a lot(most?) MY shops don't list online so need to check if they have something by calling or messaging.

Then if still need, last ditch is Facebook groups for Malaysia buy/sell, can list wanted ad or source some shop from the postings. Some are very active, see by number of members and join the most populated ones.



Sorry bro, not really a precise answer of where. I cast a wide net.

			Just some info for you guys. When to Carclick last week to fix my suspension. Did a check in SG and was told to change quite a number of parts (Absorber, linkage, linkage bush, lower arm, absorber mount, stopper) but Ah Yuan say some of those parts I mentioned still working well, end up only change absorber, linkage and linkage bush. 1 week passed, so far so good. =D He really helped me to save quite alot/QUOTE]



Just want to add that for my case Ah Hong saw the shock bush spoilt, and recommended to change. So they will check and change if necessary. 



 Anyway Singapore also has good workshops that don't ask you to change parts that are still ok. But they are still more exp. What to do, rent and labour more exp in Sgp.

Good that Carclick also provides alignment and balancing.... Not many repair workshops have this service.

technicautocare even seems cheaper for the Castrol Edge Engine Oil 5W/40 - S$98 vs $RM337. The things they check should be roughly similar, although I didn't read carefully.

Off hand I recall worn shock absorbers affect handling/braking distance and may put added strain on other suspension components. Over time tyres will have cupping/scalloped tread wear if suspension component is worn/bent. 




	

	
	
		
		

		
		
	


	
		
	






I just found this article, quite informative with regards to shock absorbers-

I seldom have 100 notes cos I always asked for 50s. RM100 and RM50 looked the same to me(colourblind).



If you do notice, cashiers will check for counterfeit only when you use RM100 but not for RM50

I visited CC yesterday hoping that CNY period few people want to operate on their car.  indeed it's true, no customers when I was there.



paid 25RM for labour to change my EO and filter. I knew the price for their labour, and its high compared to others but I wanted honest, professional, no hard sell service. I read that the market rate for labour to do EO is 10-15RM. The place was not easy to find, even with google maps as I rarely enter M'sia due to the immediate surcharge at customs. 



I visited CC mostly for their opinion on my problems. They took my car for a spin, unlike local WS that quickly think of ways to earn money without any evaluation (alignment, balancing, changing fluids, tell you to monitor first)



Some wear n tear, but all within half a day's effort. 



As long you are willing to ask, they are willing to explain. You have the freedom to decide which WS fixes it. They are the only people who explain in detail why their diagnosis is different from other WS and upon request, sat me in to demonstrate.  Based on their ability to defend their diagnosis, most people would be glad to hand it to the best hands.  sometimes confidence in a person is paramount.



while it's true that anybody can fix a Japanese car, you may spend money on services that do not fix the root of the problem and snowball to bigger money, just like asking workshop to fix air-con problem which usually results in changing the compressor. A local WS charged me $10 labour to blow the cabin air filter when I complained the aircon is not so cold. 



25RM is fantastic value for 30 mins of a lesson on what to precisely fix. I am grateful to them for sharing their knowledge thus this lengthy review that may send more noobs like me, to buy their expertise.",13-02-19
"Rm 10-RM15? Where you learnt from sia.... So far cheapest i got was RM30. Did not used CC cos of distance.

Thats what i like about sending car to JB for servicing. No hard selling, do the checks and advise accordingly. Tell you to take note of this and that. Can tahan for time being, next servicing bring your parts then change together.

You are lucky that CC not busy yesterday.



Btw in SG, based on friendship and kam cheng, labour for change EO and filter is SGD$20.

			Wa price of my JB car wash. Dunno if Malacca practice the SG plate ""premium surcharge"" policy or not. 

The most say you are SG PR so still considered local. For me I can't speak Malay, Chinese CMI in SG, go JB the Chinese service staff speak to me in English 30 seconds into the conversation. No choice go Malaysia sure kana pay ""Sinkie surcharge"", sometimes just to get them to say a few keywords in English. 



That's why now I tell the kids being able to speak proper Mandarin is very important and not just get by with mixing a bit of English into Mandarin conversations.

I msg'd the Da Sen specs bro last on 12 Feb 2019 to ask for a quote for my friend. He replied asking which exact model car but when I provided the variant, my msg went unread, msg'd again on 13th Feb for follow up and also unread/unanswered to date.



Personally, I wouldn't go back there other than for very basic jobs that they really cannot mess up. Like maybe applying tints to lamps or other small jobs. My own experience with them which I haven't related here is as follows(will put in spoiler tag as it'll be a long post)-






	

		Spoiler
	
	
		
			Brought my own speakers, amp and sub to wire up. Their labour quote is a bit less than Sheng Auto and Jackson was busy so decided to go there rather than carry my new audio gear in and out of JB. 



They took quite a while to do the full setup and sound imaging for me so I was initially happy with their work. Interior wiring was also well secured and a seemingly clean install.



Testing there the volume was high so didn't notice but once I was driving home, I realised there was a whine from the speakers corresponding to the RPM. Went back to them another day for something else and asked about the whine. He told me it's because my headunit using stock one, if use aftermarket won't have. Just basically taichi away the problem. I didn't really accept his explanation but I don't like to argue with shops so I just left it at that. 



Went to Sheng for another job and I asked Jackson to help me check on the whine. He told me the RCA cables used are poor quality, the equaliser(supplied by Da Sen) also not good and contributing to the whine and I think Da Sen had laid out the RCA on the same side as power cables also. He also said a very small amount of whine will be there regardless because of the amp which I fully understand and accept. He then pointed out inside my engine bay got unsecured wiring(although it doesn't really have much space to move and nothing to get into but still not good), my sub fuse was some crap baby fuse instead of the larger one used for the speakers and the place they ran the cables from the cabin into the engine bay was not secured. Jackson said small insects/animals and water can go in.



Went back Da Sen and they still maintain the whine cannot do much. Pointed out why the fuse got one baby one, he like no real explanation then ask me if I want the bigger fuse, I said ya, then they just come and change. No charge. I'm not 100% sure but one of the guys working there starting kpkbing about something, dunno if it's about me or something else though. He seemed to be making noise that the specky fella keep agreeing to everything. 



Went back Sheng and told Jackson to change the RCA cable to decent one. Paid another RM225 or 235 for 3x RCA and labour. They rewired it. Headunit still stock, amp still in. Whine reduced by 80% or more. Very happy with the work done at Sheng and extremely disappointed by Da Sen. Should never have wasted my time and money to do with them and to top it off, live with a super loud and annoying whine for weeks before I had Sheng resolve it.



That said, I wanted a small bit of my tail light tinted, Jackson had told me RM40/60 depending on quality. Da Sen did for me for RM20.  That's the only kind of work I'll go back to them for. Everything else, save your heartache and time and just pay the slightly higher quote from Jackson and get the job done properly. 



Side note, one of the times I was at Da Sen got SG uncle with his Porsche SUV doing work there but he was literally standing over the guy's shoulder watching the work get done and telling them to do this and that.",20-02-19

reading your experience with DaSen, the specky guy is call Ah Xian, and I think, think only, that he is the boss, correct me if I am wrong from fellow bro whom initially recommend DaSen. and yes he is the friendly type that agree and say can do to everything 



if he is indeed the boss, then his pattern cannot, will kenna makan by his own staffs, there is one guy in his shop that I super dont like, cant really describe him case no distinctive features about him.



the last trip I was there, drove in, i was friendly and said hi and even smile to that guy, but his face black until like I owe him $, upon seeing Singapore car came.



dunno issit they got bad impression of SG car owners , thinking that we troublesome and Geh Gao. 





and now that u mentioned, seems like I am not the only Singaporeans that was ignored by DaSen



their facebook page provided 2 mobile numbers, initially I always message one of the number and his profile pic is the specky guy, Ah Xian, after my messages got unread, I message the other mobile number listed in their Facebook page, he saw my message due to blue ticks, but did not reply.

So now Sheng Auto vs DaSen. 

Personally no use DaSen before. But the feedback is like text messages gone un read oredi turn me down. 

Agreed Sheng Auto could be long q at times, trade in for the good customer services and prompt respond and price is cheaper than SG, even best offered me his brother's new Honda Civic for my errands or spin ard just to kill time. These kept me going to Sheng Auto and also recommended frds to Jackson.",20-02-19

Aircon filter is just a piece of paper and you expect that has something to do with the Aircon cut off???

Not sure if rates are current-

Also dunno if chun or not-

If it is, KSL a lot cheaper...I stupidly walked over there and spent some time there also..



What I expect is fair pricing according to their land/rent/maintenance costs, not an intentional markdown from SG prices. That is carrot pricing to me.",27-02-19

to each it's own. whatever floats your boat. got slip or no slip, just drive one round you should know if they have done a good job.



and by the way, it's not a few bucks. 1 x alignment, 1 x rotation, 1 x balancing cost about SGD 40 and RM80 (got cheaper one like RM50 though).



Take RM80 divide by 3 = $26. That means savings of $13, $13 is definitely not a few bucks coz u will have 13 coins in ur pocket. 



by the way, not all wheel alignment in SG does a good job. case in point. Went for 10k service at Kah Motor but the alignment like shiat.",04-03-19

Depends if you want the big brand car cam like Blackvue, iRoad or the cheaper not much reputation type. 

If you're buying the big brand ones, usually they will sell you the camera + installation all in one price. 

If you're not fussy about brand, then can just buy online and pay labour. Use voucher, group buy etc can save quite a bit. Like what I've shared above, ask the wrong shop to do labour only, the people black face you cos you not buying the camera from them. 



Front + back is better if you're getting a new setup, since the labour cost is only a bit more. It's not cost effective if you decide to have a rear cam a few months later and pay the labour again. The camera cost of course will be higher since there are two cams. 

Usually people with only front cam (like me now) is the 2015 and before AD cam era. Nowadays new car from AD they will give front + back.

id buy the suspension from stockist and go jb ask ah yuan to install. people usually change in a pair, both front or both rear. if u can, grab a torch and check all 4 first. if needed, just change all since the ride > 10 yo. suspension is critical for a comfy and safe ride.

			My AD in SG did that to my car too as I sat in the car and we went out to diagnose certain noises which I reported. 

Really can't expect mechanics to drive the car like it's their own, regardless of how much you pay. My theory is the gearbox is made to withstand a certain level of abuse throughout its life and I know I don't abuse my gearbox on a daily basis. 



I noticed the JB car wash guys change gear without coming to a complete stop too. Happens rarely at the place that I always wash and they are quite gentle with the driving (not like some racer boy) so I still go to them.

Do your calculations... be aware of slightly more expensive parts than a 1.6l Altis and higher road tax (I feel very painful for 2l car).

			hi guys,



any recommendation for tyres? 205/55/16. both myself and friend looking to change. current on Yokohama bluearth. newbie on tires, looking for similar. 



in addition, not sure why, my front run out much faster then rear. my rear still got a good 50-60%. front almost finish, can feel the min. thread marker. balancing/rotation issue?
		
		Click to expand...
	


That's normal. You've to rotate the tyres (front move to back and back to the front) so you'll get equal wear. My workshop check for me at every servicing and they will rotate if necessary. 



What you can do now is to change two tyres only if you want to save money. 

I usually like to change all 4 at the same time. 

Do a quick check on how old the rear tyres are - if they are more 4 to 5 years old (from manufacturing), change them because the rubber material will deteriorate.",22-03-19

Tryemart 



Only LCH and trye world accept credit card the rest pay by cash. 



Usually I put old tyres at the back then new pair in front 

So that the front new will wear our faster to the same as rear old tyres. 



Then u can rotate next time and prolong the old tyres lifespan. 



When buy from them try to ask free balancing and alignment 

Usually is free balancing only, alignment free when u buy 4pcs.

1. Syarikat Lim Chin Hin

Jalan Pingai Taman Pelangi

80400 Johor Bahru, Johor.



2. BC Tyres & Rim. (Find them on FB)



Usullay, i goes to the first shop if am/ around custom area. After shop, wash car pump petrol and return.



For the 2nd shop, if i have time and craving for laska. Is a distance away.



Personally, i changed front set tires once at 2nd shop months back. Comes with free balance and only discounted alignment (sighzz). 

Buy 4 tires, free alignment and balancing.   

Recently, returned for usual wheel alignment/ rotation/ balance. The shop boss suggest dun need rotate, next round then rotate with the rear set as rear is old set. I think he suggest that to keep all 4 tires worn evenly down then next time change all fours tgt... Business mind.... lolz

1. Check battery pos connectors

2. Check external amplifier and all other addons that consume electricity.

3. Change battery



Electrical stuffs go to Sheng auto.

It might be the battery is dying.

were your interior lights on throughout the night when u discovered it was 9v the following day?



could be a problematic batt. u bought the new batt sometime sept last year? 8 months old should be under warranty? 



what's the manufacturing date code of the batt? its usually found on the box and tag. if you did not keep the tab, the code is also heat stamped on the side of the battery lid. look out for a string of 5-8 chars.



when getting new batts, avoid those that were manufactured > 2 years ago.

Go for the ""safety package"" in any Hawk Tayar branch. It includes tyre rotation, balancing and alignment plus some basic checks (in case of any leak or spoilt part, it is up to you whether you want to change, no pressure) - for my B&B car it's RM 70 + 6% SST

This car since I have taken over has always been on 300. Previously, it would make really loud screeching noise when turning in carparks with those smoother floorings and like urs would struggle to grip at times on those surfaces.



Never saw that as a big problem though and as what I was looking for is more on value for money, I went with it again. Also had the option of Michelin XM2 and Hancook at the same price. Continental would have cost 35RM more per piece.

			Go for the ""safety package"" in any Hawk Tayar branch. It includes tyre rotation, balancing and alignment plus some basic checks (in case of any leak or spoilt part, it is up to you whether you want to change, no pressure) - for my B&B car it's RM 70 + 6% SST



https://www.hawktayar.com.my/products/safety-package



Usually I do this together with my oil change.

No point repair which can easily set you back couple of hundreds...



Fuji or Sheng Auto... can look for them. Sheng Auto accessories shop, but equally good in air con too...

			I would avoid using them for the time being. They used to be quite good previously (like last year) and I have been consistently using them but recently their standards have dropped like mad.



First was the long wait (which I am ok since already in JB, spending 20 minutes won't hurt right?), then after that I noticed that the boss brought in new helpers but they don't seem to have any knowledge of proper car washing. My friend even commented that when the worker dropped the cloth on the floor, he would still pick it up and continue cleaning instead of using another cloth.



Yesterday was the final straw, I had feedback the the interior of the car was not vacuumed properly and the mat was not even taken out to 'dust it'. Yes, RM15 is 'cheap' but I knw that the car wash stations at Pelangi petrol station could do even a much better job than D'Lux.



If you are interested, probably can try Supwave as recommended by my friend. I heard that a lot of Honda Shuttle car owners go there to wash.

<Update>



Used Supwave for the first time today.

Personally, felt the wash similar to D'Lux. 

Standard at Supwave is take out car mat and vacuum. While D'Lux need to inform them then they will take it out.



Overall, i still will use both",03-05-19

xox no prob for me. ns hwy, most parts of msia - reception all ok. when u top up rm50, it will add 50 days to your validity. u should read up more from their website on the season pass. i usually activate 1gb for a month. if i use up all 1 gb after a week, just need to activate again. but if u dont use up all 1gb within a month, it will be gone. i oso hotspot it so that my tab will have internet access.

Total labour charge was 120rm. Is it getting more expensive? Or is this still a reasonable price?

Hiz. How do you decide when to change atf and brake fluid? My car manual says brake fluid change every 45k km, atf change after 165k km, however there are many websites and youtube channels that say otherwise.



And, when you change the EO, do you also change the drain plug gasket (washer)? Read that we should not be using the same old washer, but when I went to CC sometime back, they left it as it is.



ooh! And when do you all change spark plugs? My manual says every 45k, but the authorise agent say every 20k.

Took about 25mins for whole process, floor mat was taken out and wash with water and then they use air gun to dry the floor mat. First time see use air gun.



then washing of car got about 5 guys washing then when drying they will open bonnet also and use air gun to clean away some dirt and also help to top up wiper fluid with normal water.

SP, depends what type using lor.... Those normal type, 20k... Those atas one can last 40-60k km. Some SP also got long life type which can last 100k km.",05-06-19

"I've changed a few set of rims and ended up with an SSR Type C. Know what you want else you'll be swapping rims around like I did.



1. Choose between Light weight originals or Replica



Difference is in price, weight and durability. Original is the best, but Replica aren't that bad these days as well, only downside is that it's heavy.



2. Get the right size, rim width and offset



Flushed look is nice, but tires scrapping your wheel fenders won't be nice. Are you going to roll your fenders just to fit these wheels in?



This don't only happen to lowered rides, it happens to stock rides on stock suspension as well.



Know what you're using currently and read up on the above before you decide on your choice rims. Sometimes big and wide rims may not be the best for you.",17-06-19

			Since you all are on the topic of kana chop cabbage head, I also did not do my homework well. Went to Sheng Auto to change an android head unit, but need to wait about 3 hrs as there were alot of cars there. So drove ard, saw a sg car in another accessories workshop, hence went in to change head unit and reverse camera, was charged rm1.5k. Thought it was ok then, but i found out recently the head unit cost only ard sgd100 a piece, the reverse cam could be less than S$10. Haiz. Maybe they see me small size and not very well-verse in car stuff. 1-2 months already, still feel sad when I think about it...



... and the reverse cam slants to the back left.

Not to rub salt on the wounds.... This would be a relative cheap lesson for you loh...

			Imo, its very typical for a Msian to increase his price once he notice his shop or services has name to Singaporeans. I encountered really quite a lot. Once shop or services become famous through Singaporeans, price automatically increase.



That's why for me, i appreciate Ah Yuan. He might be the rarer kind of boss that wants the customer to keep coming back instead of just uping his price for profits just because his shop got famous and mostly Singaporeans.

Good to compare the prices in SG and JB before heading down. Just drive off if not happy with the price or service. 



In fact, I drove off from LCH bros recently because the foreman behaved very Yaya when we're checking out prices. Simply not happy at their attitude towards customers and they were NEVER like this before.



After some time, you will know which car wash to go as well. There are some which are very pushy especially when there's no customers. Some of the excuses that I've used... kenna accident (really happened), going to wrap car, going to repaint car, this is a rental car, car going to scrap",02-07-19

I always take the 30RM package with sealant.

They also wipe my front strut bar ultra racing without me telling them. 

Impressive. 



They also water jet wheel arch area for 4 side. 

Hardly any car wash will do that. 



Even with many car they will not rush and wash and wipe each car properly.",20-07-19

"Hi!



I have some dents and scratches on my car which needs to be fixed and repainted. I was wondering if anyone have any recommendations for workshops in jb to fix?



Thanks in advance!",25-07-19
"So I went to try out Hyperwash. RM18 because mine's a small MPV. Looks impressive that I agree, the number of people working on a car. But just 3 things to nitpick, not that it REALLY bothers me a lot.



1. The top part of my front grill is a chrome part, and water stains were so evident but 3 different people cleaned around the area on separate occasions and failed to notice it.



2. The windows were not lowered to clean the top part - so I had this line of dirt near the top of the windows when I wound them down to let the smell of durian get circulated out as much as possible.



3. My front seats were not adjusted back after they told me they were done, and I had to tidy up my own things again. But I think they are all like that, just thought their price premium would warrant a little bit more ""attention"" on small things like that.



Things that takes me less than 2 mins to settle myself, but still.



My only comparison is with R&R (of which I took a full clean and polish so that is not a good comparison) and with the Holiday Car Wash right opposite Holiday Plaza, which costs only RM12 for a wash and vacuum.



It's pretty good but I'd probably go for a standard wash at R&R next time just to compare.",25-07-19
"Best is diy lor... 



I expect SG car wash also won't adjust back the seats, turn back the blind spot mirror to the original position, car mat....etc



I experienced the above in both sg and jb car wash. I just return it back to original position.",26-07-19

"I'm guessing your engine mounts, assuming you've checked for loose items that could be rattling against the plastic compartments. Easy check to check is to open your bonnet, engage D with someone stepping on the brake for you, and you double-check if the sound is coming from the engine bay.

Why must use sg to compare? If everything use sgd to compare, there is nothing to compare. 

The cost of living in JB is pretty similar to sg. They earn 4kmyr on average so the labour fees will be quite similar to SG if u exclude exchange rate. 

So excluding parts and price solely on labour, it will be 80sg vs 80myr. 

Confirm msia cheaper liao, Still need to compare for what. 

If SG can charge 80/3 = 27 sgd, this thread will not be around. Everyone just do in Singapore. 

The main comparison is with other msia workshops which they are charging on the higher side. 

Whatâ€™s point of comparing msia workshop and spore workshop rates?",22-09-19

The cost of living in JB is pretty similar to sg. They earn 4kmyr on average so the labour fees will be quite similar to SG if u exclude exchange rate. 

So excluding parts and price solely on labour, it will be 80sg vs 80myr. 

Confirm msia cheaper liao, Still need to compare for what. 

If SG can charge 80/3 = 27 sgd, this thread will not be around. Everyone just do in Singapore. 

The main comparison is with other msia workshops which they are charging on the higher side. 

Whatâ€™s point of comparing msia workshop and spore workshop rates?

yup, totally agree but i think there is some hardcore supporter of carclick or maybe they support alot till fren fren so charge good price. i drive conti just go for simple oil change and spark plug change labour fee tio black face somemore like own them million dollar charge me 85rm which i feel is not cheap at all. some say oil change labour only 20-40rm although i still not yet found another cheaper workshop",23-09-19

Thats why i ask did he compare it with sg then come here compliant too expensive to change sensors at RM80 leh? 

Drivers head north to search for cheaper alternatives than in SG.  

Thats the primary goal. It will be a bonus if can find a cheapest source among jb workshop.

Things are getting more expensive as days goes by.

I haven tried carclick since it was mentioned here first time. 



And i won't be their customer for near future with reviews written here. 



Conti  rides always been charged higher as compared to other Asian rides. You drove conti you know the market price for a oil change. Be it in JB or sg. 

The usual workshop i used before, their price for conti is around RM80+ too for simple oil change, with all the xx point checks and service reset.



Oil change for conti drives, labour only RM20-RM40? 

This price for non-conti, i believed.

"Unsolvable coolant leaked



Hi guys



Need your help to recommend an experienced workshop that is specialized in coolant leak.

Iâ€™m driving a Suzuki SX4 ( just renew my Coe in March) and Iâ€™m having problems with leaking coolant. Below are the things that I have done previously :



1. Replace head gasket at rambo ( next to ksl)

2. Replace top gasket at lch( previously Ah yuan workshop)

3. Replace 3 radiator cap at different workshop

4. Replace water hose gasket ( car click)

5. Replace water hose clamp ( car click)

6. Replace radiator (car click)

7. Overhaul engine ( car click)



I have been to other workshops locally but none is able to solve my problem.

I donâ€™t mind paying a little more to have my problem diagnosed properly but Iâ€™m sick of trial and error methods.



Appreciate if the experts here can recommend me a proper workshop .

Thanks in advanced",26-09-19

The water pump was replace together with the head gasket at Rambo. However, I went to autosaver and they mention the water pump look used. Nevertheless , will take a look at the container and the pump.



Reason for overhaul is because I went back to champions motor and they didnâ€™t even open up the bonnet and insists require overhaul. I tried at pandan and Bukit Batok side. Quoted me $8k.

Worried kenna chopped, suggest you do check price here in sg vs jb. 

Then you consider whether to get it fix in sg or jb. If price is not much diff and you are not frequent visitor to the north, maybe do it in sg.



Some dude mentioned carclick aren't cheap anymore and sometime see boss's black face. 

For me, as long is cheaper than in sg, i saved oredi.",27-09-19

With all those parts replaced, your car is as good as having a completely new cooling system. But the problem of losing coolant still persist. Very very strange.



How much coolant is your car losing per week roughly?



Do you still see coolant on the floor or in your engine compartment, ie red or green fluid?



Have u checked the condition of your engine oil recently? Does it look murky?



Most experienced car mechs should be able to pinpoint n solve this type of problem using pressure kit or those uv dye kit.",28-09-19

Apart from the usual ws, so far recently I have try 2 ws nearby Rambo ws area. 

 Visit them for  simple jobs like change headlight bulbs and alignment. 



Was unsure of this ws so did not want them to touch my engine bay much. 



Try this ws call S&D Tyre and service near dato Sulaiman for balancing and alignment And change light bulbs. All labour as I bring own bulbs. 



Text the boss told me this price, but reach there told me additional 15RM. 

So told him I did WhatsApp before come, then his face change already and say okay stick to the price. 



The boss tall fat guy skin head, he got 3 workers under him. 

He help to change the bulbs, after change no test also weather got install properly before ask his workers take out tyres do balancing. 



Then I check myself got one side not working ask his work redo. 

Then while do balancing talk to his workers. Young chap just join 3 mths, another guy join 2 years. 



After alignment, paid and drove off, alignment was not properly done. 

Avoid at all cost this shop  





Then next day went another shop toyo tires near to dlux car wash. 

Before dlux u will see This shop. 



Went for alignment , 45RM, boss did a proper job, and even test drive the car 2 times before pass me the key. This time round alignment was down correctly. 



Boss was friendly and humble and also put back my window shades before pass me the key. 



Will KIV this shop for future use.",10-10-19

Personally, as long is cheaper than repairing it in sg, i would still heads in JB to get it fixed. This is the primary objective.

Castrol Edge Service Package - $109

Air Filter - $32

Air Con Filter - $45

Engine Flush - $26

Injector Cleaner - $5

Flush Brake Fluid - $80

Timing Belt, Tensioner, Bearing, Water Pump, Fan Belt Tensioner, Bearing - $980

Front Rear Top Mouting Bearing, Stopper damper - $1200

Front RH Wheel Bearing - $120

Front RH Wheel Bearing Housing - $200

Alignment - FOC 



GST $195.79 / Total $2992.79 



Brake pads were done prior to this major servicing as they were already worn out. Forgotten the price as it was sent to the car dealer's workshop to be done. We also changed the thermostat housing (dunno wads that) for $120 and changed the entire aircon housing due to a faulty knob so the aircon can't turn off (thankful for amazon ($230) as they didn't have the stock here) which cost me $80 labour fee at autospritez.



Honestly, Autospritez is really good and they are very popular with continental cars (especially VW) but if I can find a cheaper alternative, it certainly will be better since my car is an old car anyway. =)

Sorry, Im quite a noob lady driver haha. When I step on the accelerator hard due to needing power to overtake or climb slopes, there will be a cranking metal sound (somewhat like a misplaced gear rubbing each other ""Kruck kruck"") before my car gets the power and switch to a higher gear. I don't know if you can understand what I mean. Didn't notice this until when needing that sudden surge to climb a steep slope. The sound will disappear shortly when the car engages on the next gear. The entire pick-up is pretty laggy I must say. As of now, there is no engine light indication. Actually when I first bought the car, the engine light indicator was on. I was told it was just the brake pads being worn out and the o2 emission (dunno what) required to be changed. But they found out it was not the o2 emission thingy that caused the engine light indicator to light up. When the car was returned to me, the light was off already but I did ask for a 3 months warranty (just up) against the gearbox and engine light indicator issue. Well, the car dealer gladly oblige. But like I said, I am inexperienced and realised that the car might have more issues than I would like so I brought the car to Autospritez for a full servicing. Most of the items that were changed, to be fair, was due to wear and tear as the car was an old car after all. I am just guessing it could be a gearbox issue but the soft/spongy brakes do bother me quite a bit. As you know our roads are heavily congested on most times of the day, I feel very insecured when I have to brake often and not feeling the 3-motion brake really bothers me and I very much would not like to compromise on safety. And being a cheapo because I already spent $3K plus on the car, I would like to find a reputable workshop in JB to fix these issues and hopefully can spend lesser. Old cars are indeed a headache...",06-11-19

ok new brake fluids and pads are done. so can i just say your brakes are still not functioning right? ie most cars just need a slight depress on the brake pedal, but you have to floor the pedal to slow the car down and bring it to a halt?

Sorry but whatâ€™s odb2? Actually autospritez did mention something like the rotor is old and something pump cylinder might have to change etc. But he did mention that if I donâ€™t speed, normal daily use wouldnâ€™t pose much of a problem. Thereâ€™s also this cranking sound when my car stops (like a jerky crack crack sound), wonder if it has anything to do with the brakes as well.

odb2 is the port for mechs to plug in the scan tool to check if there are issues/error code. usually found at the driver's side, leg room area. i cannot imagine myself having to drive at > 110kmh on nshwy with this braking problem... 



ok the mech at autospitz may be correct in his diagnoses. chances are, one or more of the brake calipers is no longer functioning properly, ie very likely jammed piston/s. hence the pads cannot come in proper/full contact with the rotors even when u fully depress the pedals. once the mech locates the problematic caliper/s, he will remove the whole unit, dismatle it, clean it up and apply special high temp lubricant and grease on all the moving parts. the problem may come back if proper lubricant and grease isn;t used.



depending on what the problem is, some shops may ask u to change the whole asembly. some may suggest using a repair kit. the latter is cheaper in terms of prices. but may need to pay more for labor cos its not gonna be a 30 min job. this is one example when it makes sense to buy your own parts, and then go up north to fix it.



good luck dude.

firstly i must admire your guts to actually dare to purchase a 10 year old beetle. for brake i think you need to check is the brake pump leaking anot. As for gearbox, i not sure if yours is CVT or dry DSG. Since you hear some metal sound, i guess might be DSG and should be clutch issue? anyway gearbox is covered under lemon law. Please go back to the dealer and ask them to fix it asap. next time remember to take a photo or ask a report of the scan details of your car. If you need help for a scan of your car and stay around west side, can let me know. good luck

			Just to share, I went to try out a workshop in Permas Jaya called Tung Chun Motorsport. They do a lot of Hondas (some Google reviewer said they are Honda specialists), and I saw 2 old SG plate Civics visit them today.

I went to get my 4 engine mountings changed, plus change of EO and ATF. Only oil filter was from them. Boss gave me a package rate of MYR300, which seemed reasonable. I did ask another workshop nearby regarding change of engine mountings, and he quoted ""about MY250"". So I guess it's close enough.

Chat with another Singaporean there waiting for a friend, and he said he has been using them for the past 5-6 years, while his friend has been with them for around 11. Happy to have an alternative which seemed trustworthy.



Reached at around 10am, and done by 1215pm. I did notice the boss and his 2 workers checking something out undercarriage while preparing to change EO and ATF, but I couldn't really tell what it was. When paying, the boss then explained to me that one of the nuts was overtightened in the past, resulting in it not being able to tighten fully. Told me to notify him in advance next time and he'll get a replacement nut to resolve this issue, and assured me that it's ok for now. Therefore, I didn't have to probe what the issue was.

 It is not so much about the valuables but workers being human, will cut corners if they can. No big deal about it.

 Some workshops are honest but workers are lazy. Some little things they will reuse old parts just because they look ok. For eg, and this is a very common practice...when replacing the drive shaft boot....there is a clip that secure the grease in the boot...a lot of workers will reuse the clip just because it is already in the shape to clip back..and throw away the clip that comes with it..because is requires a lot of effort to push the newly unseasoned clip into the boot. Now this is highly not advisable because the clip is such an important part of the boot...that if it became loose..grease will leak and dirt goes in. The idea of a tight clip is to secure boot firmly..hence difficult to secure. But most workers will skip this job. There are tons of things workers can do to  save their time.",07-02-20

You say Cat is dirty. Should be running rich (not lean) if dirty. (Correct me if wrong anyone). Possible case of vacumm leak causing rich running? 



I think do the vacumm leak test first. Then check O2 sensors. Vacumm leak test (i.e smoke test) doesnâ€™t require change of parts and thus should be cheaper. 



If no vacumm leak, consider changing O2 sensors and MAF sensor (do it one at a time to isolate the issue).

Contrary to what people believe, error code only appears at the last stage. A lot of parts may not be good but still can be used and keep the car moving but just fall short of optimum performance. Gearbox and engine are big ticket items which will require at least one major overhaul inside 15 years. Gearbox itself is a complexed part. It requires the right pressure inside for it to work properly. Around 30% of ATF change produces unwanted/undesirable symptoms like jerking and funny noises. This is due to the overall harmonious balance is upsetted. All things inside kinda found its way to form a balance synergically and the new oil disturb it. Sometimes it will take a while to recover, sometimes more major reconditioning needed. Typically ATF change doesnt include filter change if you did not specifically ask for it. So next time if you are doing a ATF change, ask for the filter to be changed too.",18-02-20

 That is reconditioning gearbox. Coe how long more? If still can use...just use until coe expire. If still many yrs to go and u r particular....it will cost $2000++ to recon...and about $1500 for half cut from Japan. Half cut means taken off a scrapped car. No guarantee. Recon means they open up the gearbox and replace all the bearings and seals....with warranty. This i will recommend go JB to do...will save 50%.",19-02-20

			Usually those things spoil then change one. Coz those things do not affect comfort of car...and to be honest we wouldnt want to touch anything if nothing is wrong in the engine bay. The pipes have hardened and can easily break. It can lead to a hose of things needing to change. 



At most i would suggest to car owners is change radiator if leaks can be observed ..especially if he goes malaysia often. Leaks can still be used for a long time but most inconvenient is burst in the middle of nowhere or on a weekend.



In the ballpack of $8K including parts for normal sedan like Corolla. All original Toyota parts. 2 things I recommend only use Toyota parts. One is rubber related parts like eg bushes..stoppers..mounts. Two is anything related to brake system. Be it disc or pad etc. Reason being non Toyota parts will have a lot of funny noises due to poor quality.

 You wont doesnt mean everyone must follow you ma. The cost for upkeep an old car is high because of the need to troubleshoot when parts are not working. Over the long term it is far cheaper and less hassle to replace everything at one go. Imagine for every thing small that spoil you pay for labour of $100++ to bring down the car bottom. Shocks spoil change, spring spoil change bush spoil change shocks mounting spoil change...you will be paying how many times for labour to just change shocks related stuff?

Turn on your headlights with high beam and tap on the accelerator slightly with engine on. If the lights get brighter when you hit the accelerator (car at park/neutral), you likely have a bad alternator. 



Not sure if this works on led lights. The better option would be to use a voltmeter to check (but that takes some technical/electrical knowledge).

Turn on your headlights with high beam and tap on the accelerator slightly with engine on. If the lights get brighter when you hit the accelerator (car at park/neutral), you likely have a bad alternator. 



Not sure if this works on led lights. The better option would be to use a voltmeter to check (but that takes some technical/electrical knowledge).

Correct. Thats the workshop culture over the North. Unless after road test, they would offer for consideration if not safety concern stuffs, they would suggest change during next servicing.

If you had topped up gas before, means there is somewhere leakage oredi. AC system is a closed system. 



I go to Sheng Auto for my air con issues. They are accessories shop but Jackson is skillful when coming to air con. 

Previously, mine was air con not cold only caught in traffic jam. Before Sheng Auto, went to one quite popular shop in this thread, they checked and can't find any problem. Pressure is good, compressor ok. No leakage found. 

Same day, went to Sheng Auto for 2nd opinion. Wah lau eh, he just added some rubber cushion round the condenser sides to better seal and direct air through the condenser else some air might escape thru the sides during fan running. 

Caught in a jam during returning SG, some more hot day. 

Surprisingly, air con still cold all the way until clear custom. lolz

Until today, air con still cold cold during jam.

Mine is a 11yo boleh land Myvi...

Not exactly 1:3 but more like half price for me, of course comparing the same package and mileage SG vs JB. 



Good thing is the normal servicing was very fast. Less than 2 hours finish. SG half a day. Customer service is good, lounge area is comfortable. Don't expect the extra frills like free cleaning. But it's JB, car wash is easy to sort out.",16-05-20

Nope , missing coolant still. I have went to auto saver last month and they replace the water pump and water hoses . Total damage $300. Problem still persists and this morning went back and they told me thereâ€™s a small leakage on the top overhead gasket as they see some milky compound underneath my engine oil cap.



But he say I should be able to continue driving but I need to top up coolant every 2 weeks. If I want to resolve the issue , have to replace recon import engine at around $2000.

How old is the car and mileage? 



Perhaps get another opinion from a different workshop before confirming that the gearbox needs replacement?

I would go for servicing and tell them to do a full check for other wear and tear parts. Last time I bought 2nd hand car, drove around for 2 weeks then did the usual oil change, change tyres, alignment, change brake pads. After that, you know the basic safety parts are new and you feel safe.

I'm always polite and respectful to others, so I'm not the obnoxious customers that pisses people off.



Many yrs back, was driving a Nissan Cefiro with servicing done at Tan Chong.

Those days there was trending Fave with 50% discount off merchandise and services.



Saw a good deal for car oil change servicing at $45 and free car checks.

Went down for car service and it turn out to be a painful experience.

While waiting in lounge, the servicing advisor came in and said this and that parts worn and torn, ask want to change or not.

Car all long well maintained and serviced by Tan Chong, didn't feel anything wrong with the car, so decline the repair and stuck to basic servicing.



After one week, error light up on my dashboard say coolant fluid level low. 

Send car to Tan Chong and it cost my afew hundreds for replace coolant system.



Regretted being greedy on cheap service and got screwed by workshop for not giving them business.

I learnt that workshops don't make money from servicing.

"Bought a resale BMW.  

Send car to both a well known conti car workshop and subsequently performance motors for inspection before purchase.

Report was acceptable with some minor issues, so went ahead to buy.



Send car to another conti car workshop I previously visited because of their specialisation in certain repairs.

End up telling me the repair I intended was not worth it, wait until total breakdown before replacing parts. 

Thought so nice, don't want to earn my money.



End up tell me some belt pulley spoilt and cost hundred plus to change.

I think cannot be leh, just inspected by performance motor.

Went to take a look and noticed the belt edges were not even frayed, although the belt looked as if it was sliding off the pulley.

Pulley can be reached easily with hands.

I requested for the belt to be pushed back onto the pulley.

The workshop blocked me on whatsapp thereafter.

The pulley never gave me any problem.

hiaz.... they were really good with their other specialisation...



Should I have played along and pay for the unnecessary repair?

"Bought a resale BMW recently.

Felt gear shift has some minor issues.

BMW recommended changing the entire gear system.

I decided to seek 2nd opinion.



Got recommendations from conti car forum website to this workshop for cheaper than dealer but good repair job, and has hotel-like deco lounge.



Was persuaded into buying a extended warranty insurance at workshop.

The issues improved but not totally resolved.

When back every few weeks to let workshop find source of problem.



Started with one problem, but every send-in, will have other parts that need to be changed.

The advisor say can claim insurance so I told them to change whatever required as long as it doesn't cost me money. 



Big mistake.



The problem from day one was never totally resolved, but the car driving experience got worse because the parts changed are not as good as originals.

More problems cropped up and was not resolved.

Final straw came when ** Phase 2 started and allows for servicing. 

Thought not using car to go office, can send car in for servicing.



Servicing adviser say car axial rubber bushing crack and it is the cause of all the car problems. 

Quoted me a couple of thousands to repair and not covered by insurance. 

KNN, take me as idiot. Rubber bushing only meant to absorb vibrations leh, how can result in all kind of problems.

Trying to make up for loss income for **, take me as carrot.

I called the insurance company and realised the claims todate is astronomical and claims made for parts I wasn't told were changed.

sianx... 



Send car back to performance motors to request for repair. 

Service adviser must have noticed that I have not been doing servicing with them.

He gave me the evil eye, politely tell me need to come back another day as the problems mentioned cannot be resolved that day.

Probably assume tt I intent to waste their time for diagnosis but repair with outside workshop, so not interested in serving me.

I'm sure they meet alot of such owners.

KNN.



Now not sure what to do with car issues now. sianz...



Any bros with suggestions?

How does SG car workshop make money?



Can workshops just survive on servicing and normal wear and tear replacements?

Because if car is maintained well, that will b the only business they will get.



To be more profitable, major repairs or frequent minor repairs must occur.



When I did my maintenance with dealers, i loved driving my car as the car was well maintained.



Since I send car to private workshop, it has cost me more money, time and frustrations. 



My conclusion: In the long run, it is better worth your time and money to maintain car with dealers.

The service advisors or mechanics are not incentivised to screw you with your car.



Wondering if I'm the only one with such experiences.

Do share yours.



Pls don't ask me for names of the workshops as I have no evidence of the misdeeds and don't want to be sued for defamation.

Jokes aside, outside of AD free servicing, I've always done it with outside WS. Nowadays with Google, with abit of effort, can sometimes find out what's wrong with your car before you take it to the workshop. You'll at least have a rough idea which parts will probably need replacing and whether the workshop trying to be funny or not.

Car all long well maintained and serviced by Tan Chong, didn't feel anything wrong with the car, so decline the repair and stuck to basic servicing.



After one week, error light up on my dashboard say coolant fluid level low. 

Send car to Tan Chong and it cost my afew hundreds for replace coolant system.



Regretted being greedy on cheap service and got screwed by workshop for not giving them business.

I learnt that workshops don't make money from servicing.

That is because trying to find out the problem is lost time. Are you willing to pay them by the hour just to analyze the problem? 



Time is money. Some problems like rattling noise Damm hard to trace the issue.  



JB labour cost is cheap. 

Singapore average ws about $30 per hour labour cost



Worse are those people , spend time find the problem then say nevermind too ex don't want to repair or they then go buy parts fox elsewhere. Joke lah",21-08-20

Yes, AD servicing is more expensive.

As mentioned in earlier post, my experience is that AD don't chut  pattern and screw u with parts that suddenly require repair or replacement.

Private workshop does, may not initially but over time.

The extra cost spend on these ""sudden repairs"" would have cost more than the premium on AD servicing, not to mention the time for lost of use of car. 



Know your car and parts probably useful if ur car requires genuine repair.

Will it help if WS chut pattern for parts that requires ""sudden repairs""?



The WS servicing advisor call during normal servicing say rear axial bush crack, need to change. I decline as the quote was $2k.

Take back car, suddenly feel the road vibration. 

I know exactly prior to sending car for servicing, the car did not have such vibrations.

What would u recommend as course of action?





My respond was to give up my servicing package with them and stop patronising that WS. 

Iâ€™ve no evidence of WS misdeeds for any recourse actions.

I went to Antz before. Initially when they first started, it was quite good and friendly. After their business get expanded, waiting time is crazy. 



<Removed to prevent misunderstanding>

Update: My bad. The problem isn't the clutch, as what was from the initial diagnosis. The real issue is my gearbox actuator. I apologise any misunderstanding caused on this.



For now I either find Michael (Thomas's mechanic) who does freelance too, or just go to Thomas directly if it's bigger issue. They are good.

Conti wear rate is faster than jap/kor car

A jap car parts may last 100k but the same parts on a conti may last 70-80k only

Clutch i cant comment much as im not a mech

I think diff conti diff lifespan or mayb how well u maintain or use it will affect the lifespan



Im driving a fiat

Usual jap car timing belt lifespan is 100k, mine 80k is danger zone alr

If lucky can last 100k, unlucky 90k snapped 

Jap car engine mounting may last 70-80k or so, mine around 50-60k or mayb 40k



Driving a conti is like that

U want the nice feel and nice insulation, u have to get used to the wear n tear rate

I suggest u go research more on ur car make model first

If it's that price then he's not being ripped off lor. Fortunately, the 206 GTi had a simple manual gearbox and standard clutch (lots of 3rd party clutches on EBay!) so I never ran into that problem. Think the most expensive repair I did was about 800 bucks changing the timing belt and pump.

the peugeot automated gearbox is known as 2-tronic

or aka sensodrive for citroen applications



its usually paired to 1.4 or 1.6L or below cars in the smaller range, citroen c1/c2/c3, pug 207/208..etc



its a very simple single clutch operated with 1 clutch acutator and 1 gear selector actuator



the main issue is that for all cars with such manual automated gearboxes, batt power is very important for shifting performance, including modern vw dsg gearboxes



http://jimbutterworth.co.uk/5autobox.htm



http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/psa/c3/sensodrive/sensodrive-2.html





what is so difficult about finding data on this? tons on the net

ppl who bitch abt cannot do this and that, cannot find info, cannot find mechanic...are just plain lazy



there are > 10 individuals in sg with this gearbox in their cars already clear > 150

got 2-3 > 200k

got 1> 250k liao..already overhaul 2x

end of day its a manual gearbox for lazy sods and let u dig that ** on the other chair with left hand...manual gearboxes (and all gearboxes ) wear out at 100k

I am not bashing. I am just stating my experiences so that others can be warned. Of course, at the end of the day, buying a car is still a personal choice and people are free to make their own. But I've experienced what a Peugeot was like, and I will never touch one ever. My emotion attached to the post is proportional to how crap the car was. If you are keen, I can list down all the problems I had with the car over the 3 years and you can be judge whether it is crap or not. I almost wanted to believe mine was a lemon, until I realised many others also had the same problems as mine, and all were new cars too. To be frank, I don't know if quality improved in subsequent batches, but I am not in a hurry to bet on it soon, given the amount of actual bashing posts you can find on their official Facebook page.

"Other than the THP engine, my personal experience is that Peugeot parts are very poor in quality and do not last. This, I believed is a very big reason why their reliability is so poor. It is a pity because the car really looks good, drives well, and is very spacious for all my needs.



Just to give a few examples for my case.



1. I have to change my front brake pads twice, and brake disc once, after only 70K km mileage. I don't race or do hard braking, so to have the braking system wear out so fast is quite ridiculous. As a comparison, on my last car, I only had my first brake pad change after 90K km.



2. Aircon condenser spoilt after slightly more than 60K km mileage. When I was at Mark Cool to replace it, I saw another Peugeot 5008 (roughly same age as mine judging from number plate) with exactly the same problem. When I had problem with the aircon, AutoFrance's advice was to set aircon to 18deg to enhance the shelf-life of the aircon. Any temperature higher will cause the aircon to wear & tear faster as it needs to produce both hot and cold air to mix. I endured 18deg aircon for months but the condenser still broke down.



3. 2 of my door hinges spoilt after about 70K mileage. Workshop showed me that the ball bearings of the door hinges were made of plastic. I have never ever heard of cars where the door hinges can spoil, but when I was talking to another friend who drives a Peugeot 408, he told me he also had 2 door hinges replaced under warranty due to the same problem.



4. Fuel pump replaced on 4 Jan 2015, broke down again on 31 Dec 2015. But I must concede this is a blessing in disguise. Because it broke down in less than a year, Autofrance changed it for me FOC even though my car is already out of warranty. I do not drive for long distances after the low fuel light came on before refueling. In fact, for 80% of the time, I refuel even before the light comes on. The remaining 20% I will usually refuel in less than 20km after it came on. 



5. All the rubber seals of my door frames were torn and tattered. This is quite amazing, considering that my car is 99% parked in the shade.



6. Parking switch spoilt after 70K mileage. Once again, it seems to be a common problem.



All the above were the ""minor"" problems, so doesn't include the 6 times the car had to be towed back. On top of that, I feel that Autofrance engineers were also quite lousy. The below were my experiences.



1. Aircon problem as described above. AF engineer told me to do aircon maintenance to solve the issue. After spending $200+ to do aircon maintenance, problem still there.



2. Change my fuel pump come back discover fuel leaking.



3. Change my water pump (as part of recall) come back discover something else leaking. Brought it back and they changed my water pump again. All in, the water pump was changed 3 times.

I had my clutch replaced at BCC in mid 2012. I think it was about $1.5K. Apparently BCC and AutoFrance are the only 2 places you can do it because they have the computer equipment needed.



Haven't heard of Antz but am interested to find out more.

Main complaints are expensive parts and greater unreliability. 



Personally, the parts are more expensive. As for unreliability, hard to say. Depends on your luck. But if you're suay, and your Peugeot breaks down often, then you'll end up paying more because the parts are more expensive.",02-03-14

Some would say it's because continental cars are over-engineered in terms of design and mechanics. Cars don't need to be so complicated.



But others say they like continental cars precisely because of this reason. 



In general, stick to the popular mass-market Korea and Japanese cars if you want cheaper parts and greater choice in the workshops which can service them.",02-03-14

			Hi all, any recommended workshop that can do clutch replacement for Peugeot 107? It's the same make as Citroen C1?

Try AS Auto at Kaki Bukit autobay. Look for Ah soon.",08-03-14
"The 107/C1 uses a Toyota engine and very likely the robotized manual gearbox is from Toyota too. Overseas markets like UK have Toyota models like the Yaris and Auris with this type of clutchless manual gearbox but unfortunately none of them are sold here, hence the lack of support.

Think the last Toyota model with a similar gearbox sold here was the MR-S. Changing the clutch itself is not the difficult part, but it will need to be calibrated and that probably requires the right equipment/ software.



(Still have a set of 3 almost new NGK Iridium plugs for a 107/C1, removed from car after 5000km, anyone interested at $25 ?)",12-03-14

Anybody know any workshop/mechanics specialised in Subarus (forester xt 2.5L turbo) around JB ?

No AD please.

Preferably somewhere that's good with boxer engines.



SG workshops... book appt at 9am then only start working on my car at 11am. Ridiculous.

I know what you mean.



I went for repair job, I just jokingly ask for discount when I collected the car. The workshop readily agreed, wow!! I thought I got lucky.



Turns out... a few days later, i noticed a 2cm long, very deep scratch on my bonnet. It's so deep like it was a carve in. What did I do? I never returned to that workshop and I never fixed it.







Went to install my BBK, workshop insisted that my end-link stablizer is damgaed. Swapped it out to original OEM. Turns out, that part is original from my coilover set. Went back, made noise, the workshop ask me to purchase the original parts and they will fix it.



I asked about the cost of replaced part, I was ignored saying it's used already, no refunds.

if need do any repair works which you're the claimant, just go to your car brand's workshop, safer..

Too much effort to do replacement and steal, but probably just bad luck on your side.



Forget it, get it fixed outside. Even when I was doing some repairs at AD, they left scratches all over my fender, believe it's due to their tools left in their side pockets of overalls and while leaning on it.

My car is white and had a small dent on the engine hatch 2 years ago. It was difficult to match exact colours for a small spot repair, so the workshop just repaired the dent and resprayed the entire engine hatch. I could not tell the colour difference at all and I could not even tell where the original dent was. So 95-99% colour match can be done just that it will be more costly and time consuming for the workshop.",

Like that you suck thumb, because the leasing company will want you to cover their downtime, repairs and all.



Firstly, like I said, if the rental car is <3 years old, then claim insurance sure get a new bumper. Secondly, once they go back to their leasing company, the company sure sharpen their knives. Send to spray also need 3 days, that's $300 rental lost + bumper spray another $200+, admin fee $200?



$700 to spray whole bumper? Your workshop knife also very sharp.",

You are rich... $700, I sure smack the workshop lol.





Anyway sensor is independent of the bumper, unless the sensor is not working, which you only need to replace the part, $70? + Spray = $300 would be enough. Downtime 1 day $100 rental, total $400.



If you agree to the leasing company demands, go down to the car, scratch the bumper hard, make a hole, and whack the sensor until spoil, then say you want the damaged parts after they are done replacing. For sure they will not be replacing but repairing, but you are at their mercy as it's your fault for hitting them.



Seriously...

1. Pay - you can discuss a bit more to lower their demands

2. Claim insurance - this will inflate the payment amount and also up your premium.",

5. Ask someone pump the brake and hold. Then you release the nipple and old fluid will be channelled into the container.

6. Repeat 6-7 times or more till you see clear fluid out from the hose for step 5.On each side of the rear wheels.

7. Make sure you top up new fluid after step 5.

8. Perform same for the front 2 wheels.

Just replaced my radiator using koyorad Oem part. The fun of resolving issue for older car.

Thanks to Convid. Now WFH... Plenty of spare times. DIY, becomes my new hobby. lolz",
DIY is quite fun indeed. Especially for people who like cars. I can change all sort of filters for my car except ATF because I don’t have the car lifting machine.,

Yes, have to overcome this. I was struggling like you initally. Done once, you know the tools and knowhow liao. My neigbour helps me on the fabrication of some special tools as common tools, we shared since.

Br. Fluid flushing, SP tools and even specal handles for jacking up the car and car stand.



Is a hussel at first but now looks easy as 1234..lolz



3 weeks back, neighbour's frd came for ATF fluid replacement on its Elantra. Yeah, saw him diamante the protective cover under the engine. Is a bit challenging. He did it alone though we are around to assist. lolz

Indeed. Safety must be in place before sliding underneath the car. 

Use the stock jack and understand where is the jack point of your car model. Then purchase two pcs of car stand. 

Always rest your car on these stands and not on the jacks.

How you change brake oil? Remove all the wheel, or just partial replacement at the brake reservoir? I did once at my workshop, used only 500ml. Even I do it for my bike, will used 3-400ml alr..",
"Mr Khor Joo Heng, 60, was hurrying about his stuffy motor workshop in AutoCity at Sin Ming when he was asked what he would do if Singapore achieved its aim of phasing out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2040.



""Die lah,"" he quickly told CNA without missing a step, shuffling from car to lorry wearing stained overalls with tools in hand.



Mr Khor is among a number of traditional motor workshop owners who said they would likely shut down if Singapore's vehicle population becomes fully electric, attributing it to factors like advancing age and a potentially crippling lack of business.



In particular, the workshop owners pointed to how brand new electric vehicles (EVs) would come with extended warranty periods – longer than some ICE vehicles – and thus be exclusively maintained at authorised agents, ending their stream of customers.



And with no potential successors intending to enter what could be an increasingly niche and costly market, the workshop owners said they were only biding their time before retirement.

Mr Khor is among a number of traditional motor workshop owners who said they would likely shut down if Singapore's vehicle population becomes fully electric, attributing it to factors like advancing age and a potentially crippling lack of business.



In particular, the workshop owners pointed to how brand new electric vehicles (EVs) would come with extended warranty periods – longer than some ICE vehicles – and thus be exclusively maintained at authorised agents, ending their stream of customers.

OBD stands for onboard diagnostics, it's merely a port for diagnostics to do. How you want to use it depends on the competency of the mechanic.



In this case, no fault registered because it is well within design parameters which does not take efficiency into much consideration. Newer cars that cares about efficiency will produce fault codes related to it.



However, efficiency can be determined by analyzing data, which the mechanic can choose to read out.",

			Mr Khor Joo Heng, 60, was hurrying about his stuffy motor workshop in AutoCity at Sin Ming when he was asked what he would do if Singapore achieved its aim of phasing out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2040.



""Die lah,"" he quickly told CNA without missing a step, shuffling from car to lorry wearing stained overalls with tools in hand.



Mr Khor is among a number of traditional motor workshop owners who said they would likely shut down if Singapore's vehicle population becomes fully electric, attributing it to factors like advancing age and a potentially crippling lack of business.



In particular, the workshop owners pointed to how brand new electric vehicles (EVs) would come with extended warranty periods – longer than some ICE vehicles – and thus be exclusively maintained at authorised agents, ending their stream of customers.



And with no potential successors intending to enter what could be an increasingly niche and costly market, the workshop owners said they were only biding their time before retirement.

			Went for servicing and they quote $180 . After that go back pick car become charge $14++

Their excuse they say never include change of tyres.

Hate this kind of places quote one thing and then prata final bill

change tyres and you expect $180 all in? 



are you saying they changed tyres without your approval? 



if no approval, then ask them change back , don't need to pay.

In duck84 csb thread … gpgt the invoice and breakdown before we talk,
"I dont think its anything wrong. General servicing of $100+ is only to change engine oil and check wear and tear parts/lights etc. Tyres one piece is easily $200-300. Even you dont change there, go outside change price also about the same. Both ways also need to pay what.



I am more afraid of those workshops u do servicing, they change engine oil for you charge you cheap cheap $88 but then never check anything only turn yr wheels brake pads ok pass.



You want this kind not afraid meh.

Not like they tell u got service but nothing done thats dishonest.



Give them a break la. Not easy operating a workshop and everyone is trying very hard to satisfy the customer. Also not few tens of k. Just pay and move on",

"22 Dec : Sent my car to them for a decarbon using their km+ products . Waited half a day for it to be done. Tested my car it started misfiring. Was charged $210 for the decarbon.Stayed til 9pm to watch them diagnose told me my timing chain has jump a tooth. I said ok so went to buy the parts myself out of goodwill as my car parts are hard to find



23 Dec: Delivered the parts to their workshop.



29 Dec:  They took 6 days to fix my timing chain and best part fix till oil started leaking. Normally workshops can do it in a day or half a day. Best part fix till oil leak, driving back home car started misfiring again . Which means timing chain wasn't the issue at all? Charged $450 for the labour.





30 Dec: Brought the car back let again and let them slowly diagnose.



 One of the workers called ah ying said if wanna overhaul he wont fix the oil leak as engine will take out so fix all or one go.

Had enough i told the lady boss and rose off. Suddenly she and her team suggested a overhaul? wtf. Cant find the problem they messed up so they said overhaul. I was pissed and argued with them and talked to the guy boss called ah hui. He told me the problem can be fixed without overhauling for free. i said ok give him some time. 



 The boss and his worker said ok they will take responsibility by giving me a free overhaul which did not happen . Said my ecu have problem blah blah they send for repair. in fact ecu wasn't spoilt



10 Jan : I let them diagnose till yesterday . They fixed the oil leak but found out the ignition coil suppressor was the one that spoilt. Instead of replacing the part for me they did a quick fix by using gum on the suppressor. Collected the car and test drove. It started misfiring again leaving the workshop. Came back questioned the ah hui why dont want to just replace the suppressor for me . He told me cause I said i am not paying a single cent so he just did a quick fix and smiled at me & used wrapping tape and wrap the ignition coil suppressor. I could not believe at this stage he still wanna play with me. 



11 Jan: car started misfiring again. Back to square one.  Decided enough is enough. I called the boss rose and she said she will order for me one ignition coil suppressor and install but i said its okay . I had enough i do not want them to touch my cars anymore. Clowns such as this ah hui still have the cheek to smile at me and play with the words when doing his quickfix 



In short, i basically spent $900 including parts and labour to give me problems. i see their workers working so late even 9pm 1am kind. MOM pls look into this.

Shouldn't it be overhaul if engine misfires?",12-01-22
"Misfire usually one of the few things along fuel line. 



1) sparkplug(first to do coz cheapest)

2) sparkplug cable

3) ignition coil

4) fuel injector



Usually fault is one of the line. A good workshop will just test a line one by one for fault. A lousy workshop will try to prata here prata there and upsell services because quite simply their chance to make money is here.



Your fault in trusting them and leaving car with them. It is very risky especially if you dont know them. Reason being they can swap your good part with faulty part and you wont know. Never leave car with a workshop you not close unless problem nailed and they guarantee issue fixed or no bill. Price MUST be first agreed. 



Workshop dislike what kind of customer the most? The type who likes to ownself buy parts. Literally eats into their margin and they usually mark up parts by 50 to 100%. You wanna buy own parts make sure you close with the workshop and you 'pay them back' one way or the other. Can't have the cake and eat it too.



Always seek second or third opinion. Never let them do unless they nailed the issue. Problem is diagnost is something they dont like to do as it is time consuming and they dunno how long it might take and they cannot charge you for that. So usually they like to recommend wholesale change this change that to test water. If you ok then their chance is here > sharpen knife to chop.",12-01-22

pouring solvent down spark plug holes is one way of cleaning valves and piston crowns...but a bit drastic and may cause issues if big chunks of carbon break off

 cleaners like Caltex Techron that are added to the fuel tank will also work to clean valves but slowly. and these won't work for direct injection engines",

He sugg clean the throttle 1st. If cant nd to chg dono wat i forgt. Saw him spray a can of what I forgt. Saw the throttle body quite dirty. Gt 2 small holes outside the throttle body too. He also spray. Everything abt 30min. Done. Nvr had the issue anymore.



Can TS or any1 elaborate wat is decarbon? Wat solvent they use n clean wat part? I believe is engine, so they pour the solvent into the engine? But TS say mechanic meddle w the ignition coils parts? The above I did is not decarbon rite?

			22 Dec : Sent my car to them for a decarbon using their km+ products . Waited half a day for it to be done. Tested my car it started misfiring. Was charged $210 for the decarbon.Stayed til 9pm to watch them diagnose told me my timing chain has jump a tooth. I said ok so went to buy the parts myself out of goodwill as my car parts are hard to find



23 Dec: Delivered the parts to their workshop.



29 Dec:  They took 6 days to fix my timing chain and best part fix till oil started leaking. Normally workshops can do it in a day or half a day. Best part fix till oil leak, driving back home car started misfiring again . Which means timing chain wasn't the issue at all? Charged $450 for the labour.





30 Dec: Brought the car back let again and let them slowly diagnose.



 One of the workers called ah ying said if wanna overhaul he wont fix the oil leak as engine will take out so fix all or one go.

Had enough i told the lady boss and rose off. Suddenly she and her team suggested a overhaul? wtf. Cant find the problem they messed up so they said overhaul. I was pissed and argued with them and talked to the guy boss called ah hui. He told me the problem can be fixed without overhauling for free. i said ok give him some time.



 The boss and his worker said ok they will take responsibility by giving me a free overhaul which did not happen . Said my ecu have problem blah blah they send for repair. in fact ecu wasn't spoilt



10 Jan : I let them diagnose till yesterday . They fixed the oil leak but found out the ignition coil suppressor was the one that spoilt. Instead of replacing the part for me they did a quick fix by using gum on the suppressor. Collected the car and test drove. It started misfiring again leaving the workshop. Came back questioned the ah hui why dont want to just replace the suppressor for me . He told me cause I said i am not paying a single cent so he just did a quick fix and smiled at me & used wrapping tape and wrap the ignition coil suppressor. I could not believe at this stage he still wanna play with me.



11 Jan: car started misfiring again. Back to square one.  Decided enough is enough. I called the boss rose and she said she will order for me one ignition coil suppressor and install but i said its okay . I had enough i do not want them to touch my cars anymore. Clowns such as this ah hui still have the cheek to smile at me and play with the words when doing his quickfix



In short, i basically spent $900 including parts and labour to give me problems. i see their workers working so late even 9pm 1am kind. MOM pls look into this.



Have so many shops and cant even settle something they caused in the first placed.

My car is a 1996 2 door mercs btw.



Please help me share this on mycarforum everywhere.

Ermm the remarks did not paint the full picture I think.  



 Car parts got different tier.  Parts, made by car manufacturer. Parts, car manufacturer sub to contractor to make but still label as orginal parts as it is used during build up of the car. Parts, car manufacturer/main contractor gave licence to sub contractor to make and labeled as OEM. 



To put it as layman term, Borneo motor themselves are also stocklist, but they deal with original parts. Outside stocklist will source and deal with all tiers of the car parts.  I believed car accessories like certain car brand car keys, the AD/car manufacturer kept the monoply to themselves. You still can get the key from outside stockist, but the proper coding still at AD side.

			Cars are very pretty complex and interdependent, usually when something fail, a series of failure will also pop up. That’s why workshops always like to chop carrot on these, cause a layman won’t know exactly what is the issue.



I personally believe stock is best cause the manufacturer has the best R&D and optimisation balance of cost, longevity, maintenance and performance. Of course upgrades are possible provided you are willing to calibrate the whole thing. Often a driver might just upgrade one part and ignore the rest, that’s why issues pop up. For example, upsizing rim size means the suspension system should be calibrated, but a lot of workshops don’t, just put the bigger rims and that’s it.



Then there’s also areas where outside workshops have no way to address, like body rigidity, metal fatigue etc. Like some people like to add reinforcement cross bars to make the car more rigid when cornering. The stress has to go somewhere, if the body cannot flex to dissipate the stress, it will be absorbed into the chassis, then over time cracks will happen

Really depends. To meet the emission legistation and the profitability of the sales of cars, R&D can come from the point to change car within certain years like 10 years or less. Car manufacturers aim is not to provide longevity. 



Hence, newer cars (petrol or diesel) need to de-carbonised due to the egr. Egr chocked or failed, likely to cause manifold intake melting or burn. But egr is needed to pass euro emission.

For basic parts yes but some factory parts are not of top quality but acceptable quality. Parts like shocks and brakes can be easily upgraded for a better ride. Sound system also. 



Cars have few thousands of parts all working together harmoniously. Everything needs to be working but after awhile not every part is perfect so it will equalises each other and then offset by itself. Sometimes you change a part, you disturbed the harmony and the pressure point shifted and then slowly one by one, other parts give way. For eg radiator, the parts need to work at high temp for so long so it has harden and if you wanna change any radiator related parts, make sure you get all the hose and pipe and joints because any moment one of it will just break.",

Oic going to stall at stationary then yes...it is misfiring. You only change one coil? What tool you use to pull out the coil sia",
"soarer said:
			
		
	
	
		
		
			No. Misfire is lose power. When you moving it is supposed to accelerate smoothly but say on second or third gear it suddenly loses power. That is misfiring.



Car vibrating at stationary is not misfiring. This is very common with old cars because the 3 lines lose its efficiency. Air line, fuel line and electricity line. A lot of cables not operating at optimum so unfortunately your issue may be caused by many many issues.



If so it is correct to decarbon for a start. But decarbon has many different ways depending on workshop. Usually they will just do the throttlebody for $20. Serious cases they will do the manifold. More serious cases they will wash the cat.



But from my personal experiences, vibration can be also from bad bushes/mountings so you really need to get that sorted first. Nexr observe rpm. Your rpm should not fluctuate.

			22 Dec : Sent my car to them for a decarbon using their km+ products . Waited half a day for it to be done. Tested my car it started misfiring. Was charged $210 for the decarbon.Stayed til 9pm to watch them diagnose told me my timing chain has jump a tooth. I said ok so went to buy the parts myself out of goodwill as my car parts are hard to find



23 Dec: Delivered the parts to their workshop.



29 Dec:  They took 6 days to fix my timing chain and best part fix till oil started leaking. Normally workshops can do it in a day or half a day. Best part fix till oil leak, driving back home car started misfiring again . Which means timing chain wasn't the issue at all? Charged $450 for the labour.





30 Dec: Brought the car back let again and let them slowly diagnose.



 One of the workers called ah ying said if wanna overhaul he wont fix the oil leak as engine will take out so fix all or one go.

Had enough i told the lady boss and rose off. Suddenly she and her team suggested a overhaul? wtf. Cant find the problem they messed up so they said overhaul. I was pissed and argued with them and talked to the guy boss called ah hui. He told me the problem can be fixed without overhauling for free. i said ok give him some time.



 The boss and his worker said ok they will take responsibility by giving me a free overhaul which did not happen . Said my ecu have problem blah blah they send for repair. in fact ecu wasn't spoilt



10 Jan : I let them diagnose till yesterday . They fixed the oil leak but found out the ignition coil suppressor was the one that spoilt. Instead of replacing the part for me they did a quick fix by using gum on the suppressor. Collected the car and test drove. It started misfiring again leaving the workshop. Came back questioned the ah hui why dont want to just replace the suppressor for me . He told me cause I said i am not paying a single cent so he just did a quick fix and smiled at me & used wrapping tape and wrap the ignition coil suppressor. I could not believe at this stage he still wanna play with me.



11 Jan: car started misfiring again. Back to square one.  Decided enough is enough. I called the boss rose and she said she will order for me one ignition coil suppressor and install but i said its okay . I had enough i do not want them to touch my cars anymore. Clowns such as this ah hui still have the cheek to smile at me and play with the words when doing his quickfix



In short, i basically spent $900 including parts and labour to give me problems. i see their workers working so late even 9pm 1am kind. MOM pls look into this.

No. Misfire is lose power. When you moving it is supposed to accelerate smoothly but say on second or third gear it suddenly loses power. That is misfiring.



Car vibrating at stationary is not misfiring. This is very common with old cars because the 3 lines lose its efficiency. Air line, fuel line and electricity line. A lot of cables not operating at optimum so unfortunately your issue may be caused by many many issues.



If so it is correct to decarbon for a start. But decarbon has many different ways depending on workshop. Usually they will just do the throttlebody for $20. Serious cases they will do the manifold. More serious cases they will wash the cat.



But from my personal experiences, vibration can be also from bad bushes/mountings so you really need to get that sorted first. Nexr observe rpm. Your rpm should not fluctuate. It should be around 650 onward. If rpm drops to around 500 then your task is to solve the rpm issue and not the vibration symptom.

i ran over a big pothole while accelerating. After that my car lost some response, pick up became heavier and having a droning sound.



my ws diagnosed saying all mounts and suspension related ok but say maybe your gearbox low pressure but not urgent. i did some google search and found this dr gb.



after test drive he told me to just change filter and oil. quoted 280. i said ok as price usu is 400.

after drained out my gb oil, the lady boss told me quoted wrongly. should be 380 as filter and oil alr 280. proceeded as no choice.



then another hour later called me say found metal scraps in the oil. now say need to overhaul.

so from a change oil become an overhaul. This is esp when during the test drive, the towkay still told me confidently your gb is fine, all gears ok, change oil settle. also told me he started with the famous AMK GB ws starting w letter E, which i have some experience with.



well, for me, i wont go back again. what i like is clarity and experience regarding car issues. not baiting or 2nd guessing.

Oh I stand corrected. For one I dont know how many workshops are there in Singapore so I dont know how many % of workshops are that special. But many workshops that i know or been to around ubi and tampines side are authorised repairer or affiliated to an insurance company. On hand I can count 7 to 8. Maybe you look at ntuc list, there are not many but there are many insurance companies in Singapore. Usually workshops have to do things by the book if they want such business but it doesnt mean they are 100% honest. That affiliation means nothing to me. If anything they usually charge abit higher for walkins coz they come with 'status'.",

Cars are very pretty complex and interdependent, usually when something fail, a series of failure will also pop up. That’s why workshops always like to chop carrot on these, cause a layman won’t know exactly what is the issue.



I personally believe stock is best cause the manufacturer has the best R&D and optimisation balance of cost, longevity, maintenance and performance. Of course upgrades are possible provided you are willing to calibrate the whole thing. Often a driver might just upgrade one part and ignore the rest, that’s why issues pop up. For example, upsizing rim size means the suspension system should be calibrated, but a lot of workshops don’t, just put the bigger rims and that’s it.



Then there’s also areas where outside workshops have no way to address, like body rigidity, metal fatigue etc. Like some people like to add reinforcement cross bars to make the car more rigid when cornering. The stress has to go somewhere, if the body cannot flex to dissipate the stress, it will be absorbed into the chassis, then over time cracks will happen",

			its normal...once u 'fix' something or do something drastic as ""decarbon"" to an old car...all the other problems will surface out....problems that are already there but 'hidden' by all the layers of carbon/gunk/sludge....same goes us suspension parts, engines, especially transmission.. All your other problem parts likely have to replace already but also they have not find the main problem part.



The workshop likely is go thru the list of possible faults starting from the most likely and if they see that part got issue, will suggest to change first. They dont have the time, expertise (simpler jobs not checked by the main guy) to check everything, especially for a 1 time only customer that will just pay for that 1 part replacement and will complain if they list out all your problem parts (for an old car is likely everything)



i always question my regular mechanic why my car so few replacement needed ..i always ask, this one need to replace? (AKA upgrade))..that one worn out already need to replace? (AKA upgrade), when i drive my brakes not so good, need to replace ? (AKA upgrade) ..even keep ask if my engine need overhaul...he will say wait till got problem first lar...anyway he replace a few of the wear parts already

This is true. For old cars, some symptoms are caused by combination of multiple issues. Sometimes it is extremely tedious to solve even a simple issue. Your objective is to solve issue but workshop's objective is to dig as much as possible offering related/relevant parts change. See the difference in objectives? So you cannot say yes to everything they suggest. You need to sieve out those that really is pure prata and say no to them.",

so from a change oil become an overhaul. This is esp when during the test drive, the towkay still told me confidently your gb is fine, all gears ok, change oil settle. also told me he started with the famous AMK GB ws starting w letter E, which i have some experience with. 



well, for me, i wont go back again. what i like is clarity and experience regarding car issues. not baiting or 2nd guessing.",

To reiterate my point, parts are not manufactured by car makers. They are all outsourced. Mercedes do not make compressor or sparkplug or ignition coil. These are all outsouced and for a certain quality they will put a stamp of the brand. These parts are not sold by factory but authorised parts dealers. Authorised part dealers will sell to whoever wants to buy. You can be a car owner or an agent or a workshop..no problem..they just want to sell.",

			22 Dec : Sent my car to them for a decarbon using their km+ products . Waited half a day for it to be done. Tested my car it started misfiring. Was charged $210 for the decarbon.Stayed til 9pm to watch them diagnose told me my timing chain has jump a tooth. I said ok so went to buy the parts myself out of goodwill as my car parts are hard to find



23 Dec: Delivered the parts to their workshop.



29 Dec:  They took 6 days to fix my timing chain and best part fix till oil started leaking. Normally workshops can do it in a day or half a day. Best part fix till oil leak, driving back home car started misfiring again . Which means timing chain wasn't the issue at all? Charged $450 for the labour.





30 Dec: Brought the car back let again and let them slowly diagnose.



 One of the workers called ah ying said if wanna overhaul he wont fix the oil leak as engine will take out so fix all or one go.

Had enough i told the lady boss and rose off. Suddenly she and her team suggested a overhaul? wtf. Cant find the problem they messed up so they said overhaul. I was pissed and argued with them and talked to the guy boss called ah hui. He told me the problem can be fixed without overhauling for free. i said ok give him some time.



 The boss and his worker said ok they will take responsibility by giving me a free overhaul which did not happen . Said my ecu have problem blah blah they send for repair. in fact ecu wasn't spoilt



10 Jan : I let them diagnose till yesterday . They fixed the oil leak but found out the ignition coil suppressor was the one that spoilt. Instead of replacing the part for me they did a quick fix by using gum on the suppressor. Collected the car and test drove. It started misfiring again leaving the workshop. Came back questioned the ah hui why dont want to just replace the suppressor for me . He told me cause I said i am not paying a single cent so he just did a quick fix and smiled at me & used wrapping tape and wrap the ignition coil suppressor. I could not believe at this stage he still wanna play with me.



11 Jan: car started misfiring again. Back to square one.  Decided enough is enough. I called the boss rose and she said she will order for me one ignition coil suppressor and install but i said its okay . I had enough i do not want them to touch my cars anymore. Clowns such as this ah hui still have the cheek to smile at me and play with the words when doing his quickfix



In short, i basically spent $900 including parts and labour to give me problems. i see their workers working so late even 9pm 1am kind. MOM pls look into this.

			Ermm the remarks did not paint the full picture I think.

Car parts got different tier.  Parts, made by car manufacturer. Parts, car manufacturer sub to contractor to make but still label as orginal parts as it is used during build up of the car. Parts, car manufacturer/main contractor gave licence to sub contractor to make and labeled as OEM.

To put it as layman term, Borneo motor themselves are also stocklist, but they deal with original parts. Outside stocklist will source and deal with all tiers of the car parts.  I believed car accessories like certain car brand car keys, the AD/car manufacturer kept the monoply to themselves. You still can get the key from outside stockist, but the proper coding still at AD side.

All your other problem parts likely have to replace already but also they have not find the main problem part.



The workshop likely is go thru the list of possible faults starting from the most likely and if they see that part got issue, will suggest to change first. They dont have the time, expertise (simpler jobs not checked by the main guy) to check everything, especially for a 1 time only customer that will just pay for that 1 part replacement and will complain if they list out all your problem parts (for an old car is likely everything)

can recommend your workshop.



Most workshops nowadays.. i dare say all.. dont diagnose problem one.

u tell them the symptom, they point you to the problem and suggest change this.



But i actually agree with changing coz fixing might give u a good run for a short-term.. while changing part is 1 time .. can last for the expected lifespan.



example, sparkplugs, ignition coil. .just change whole set.  they roughly same lifespan..1 spoilt means the others is going to gg soon one after another, u go workshop labour ...is not cheap. just cheap one shot.



another example is .. engine mounting.. Dont change one only..change the whole set.",

Most workshops are authorised repairer for insurance companies. It doesn't make them a honest workshop if you walk in. There is no such thing as a honest or dishonest workshop, it's only if the workshop wants to be honest with which customer and makan which customer. They are here for profit making so their focus point must be on that. If you unfortunately cross into their target point then too bad. Sometimes the way you talk matters. The way you counter them matters. The way you are generous with them matters. If you 'take care of them, they will take care of you. If the workshop has some workers and you eh gam with one of them, get his contact. Whenever you drop by, get him lunch/drinks. Offer him ciggs. Be nice to that one worker. Afterall, cars go through worker's hand. Not the boss.



Workshops endorsed by Insurance companies doesnt mean cheap. It means they likely will do things by the book. There are many ways to makan you, not only by being dishonest.",

			22 Dec : Sent my car to them for a decarbon using their km+ products . Waited half a day for it to be done. Tested my car it started misfiring. Was charged $210 for the decarbon.Stayed til 9pm to watch them diagnose told me my timing chain has jump a tooth. I said ok so went to buy the parts myself out of goodwill as my car parts are hard to find



23 Dec: Delivered the parts to their workshop.



29 Dec:  They took 6 days to fix my timing chain and best part fix till oil started leaking. Normally workshops can do it in a day or half a day. Best part fix till oil leak, driving back home car started misfiring again . Which means timing chain wasn't the issue at all? Charged $450 for the labour.





30 Dec: Brought the car back let again and let them slowly diagnose.



 One of the workers called ah ying said if wanna overhaul he wont fix the oil leak as engine will take out so fix all or one go.

Had enough i told the lady boss and rose off. Suddenly she and her team suggested a overhaul? wtf. Cant find the problem they messed up so they said overhaul. I was pissed and argued with them and talked to the guy boss called ah hui. He told me the problem can be fixed without overhauling for free. i said ok give him some time.



 The boss and his worker said ok they will take responsibility by giving me a free overhaul which did not happen . Said my ecu have problem blah blah they send for repair. in fact ecu wasn't spoilt



10 Jan : I let them diagnose till yesterday . They fixed the oil leak but found out the ignition coil suppressor was the one that spoilt. Instead of replacing the part for me they did a quick fix by using gum on the suppressor. Collected the car and test drove. It started misfiring again leaving the workshop. Came back questioned the ah hui why dont want to just replace the suppressor for me . He told me cause I said i am not paying a single cent so he just did a quick fix and smiled at me & used wrapping tape and wrap the ignition coil suppressor. I could not believe at this stage he still wanna play with me.



11 Jan: car started misfiring again. Back to square one.  Decided enough is enough. I called the boss rose and she said she will order for me one ignition coil suppressor and install but i said its okay . I had enough i do not want them to touch my cars anymore. Clowns such as this ah hui still have the cheek to smile at me and play with the words when doing his quickfix



In short, i basically spent $900 including parts and labour to give me problems. i see their workers working so late even 9pm 1am kind. MOM pls look into this.



Have so many shops and cant even settle something they caused in the first placed.

My car is a 1996 2 door mercs btw.

My office colleague was like you, try to save money. End up, Cheapo workshop drop a ball bearing into his engine. When he drive it back home, the engine self-destruct.

I top up gas because passenger side air is warm while the driver side is cold.

"Pretty standard fare, any proper workshop will have the proper tools to do it. Especially the ignition coil pull out tool, to access the ignition coil to remove your plugs from.  



If stinging on costs is an issue, I suggest you go to a stockist for your car brand, and purchase the correct part numbers for the stock plugs, then bring them to a workshop of your choice for the labour only.  



Doing this of course the shop need not mark up pricing on parts to you, however they got no liability to provide you warranty on parts either. It is entirely your own, and your risk level.",

I don quite lik those iridium or platinum plugs cos I heard these plugs draw higher currents n more hotter,though last longer. May dmg the car. Dono hw true. So i stick w copper plugs.

wait until the engine is cold, aluminium is soft when hot, more likely to damage the threads in the cylinder head if you do it when the engine is hot



use compressed air to blow clean the engine, you don't want rubbish or sand to drop into the cylinder



use compressed air to blow into the spark plug tunnel, there will be lots of fine sands and dust inside, same reason as above



loosen the spark plug halfway, blow again, there will be some crust dropping from the spark plug threads when you are removing



apply a little anti seize compound on the new spark plug threads

Satki tio pwn change engine mounts, LOL.



Mine has similar issues but as my car and plugs are still quite new, I suspect ignition coil as the tachometer was erratic.



If spark plugs are Iridium type and still within mileage, don't change, ask workshop to do a test using their used spark plugs to isolate fault.



If test plugs are good, then proceed to troubleshoot ignition coil by pulling up one by one. The coil which does not affect the erratic rpm movement is the faulty coil. I saw all this being carried out live by my mechanic.

In the end I change two coils just to be safe, the other being about to fail. 



For ignition coils, no need to change all at once if your mileage is still low below 80K. Coils can theoretically last up to 150K km.",

Some fault codes can be ignored, eg if aftermarket engine tuning stuff was installed. Many cars have cabin outside air inlet closed permanently. Will also have fault code but can be ignored.



Other fault codes involving oil leaks from engine, transmission, power steering, brake cylinder will not be detected until very late. Some parts have no sensors, while most have only one sensor for the entire circuit eg brake fluid, coolant. So there is no warning early on, and very few people bother to examine their car park lots for leaks, check its color using paper towel, and take a sniff to determine the type of fluid. So they wait for the engine light to come out, by which time the lost of fluid is more advanced, and gets compounded by multiple leaks from other parts.



Things like serpentine belt, belt tensioner, roller guide wear, timing chain tensioner, timing chain, viscous fan clutch, alternator clutch, engine mount, transmission mount, damper, rear differential hub, radiator, aircon compressor, condensor, evaporator, oil feed to center housing of turbocharger, fuel filter, engine oil filter housing, water pump, rear wheel drive shaft universal joint, parking brake pad wear, parking brake cable, front hood release cable, front and rear wiper, multiple harnesses, hoses, cables have no sensors.

i didn't know spark plug cost so much, since i seldom change them, only once a while during servicing.



actually, the main problem w spark plugs is carbon accumulation. just dismantle them, soak them in turpentine (or other solvent) to dissolve the carbon, just an old tooth brush to clean the contact point, should able to restore its function.





what's wrong w yr car ? 



jerky ? high petrol consumption, but no power ?



if i'm u, i would just change the spark plug first and monitor if the problem persist. 



the service guy can use a handheld computer to check the fault. 



i was told spark plug were not spoilt easily w current cars. 



maybe 20-30 yrs ago, cars engine not so good, spark plug get dirty and spoil more easily.



at one time, still got expensive platinum spark plugs, which just selling to those willing to pay a premium

its hyundai oem plugs, i truly dunno if its fake or not. The model number matches. But i have measured the primary and secondary coil resistances of ignition coil using a digital multimeter and they are in line with the normal readings ranges, slightly better than the existing plugs. Better plugs will be any of those performance plugs where there is a very high secondary coil resistance. The purpose of the plugs is only to convert the 12v into 20kv so high secondary coil resistance is desirable. (Sorry was referring to ignition coils and not spark plugs lol)



They are ordinary copper plugs instead of denso irridium, actually in terms of fuel economy, its better to use copper plugs. My COE car is just for another 2 years, so there is no problems.",

"Dealer: Gears & Gasoline

Workshop: Vermogen Group

Location: both @ Jalan Lam Huat



Avoid at all cost.



Nightmare happened to a friend, tried to remediate on her behalf and was met with unprofessionalism and absolute rudeness, one would think a customer would get basic courtesy of sorts, I understand some may point out that my friend should have done her due diligence, but her being a first time buyer, the process can be a little intimidating even with homework of sorts done.



Salesperson ZY was pushy, intentionally withheld information, e.g condition of car, non-LTA approved components that will fail inspection, also he did not explained the difference between consignment or dealer unit and that lemon law is not applicable for consignment units.



3 weeks into the ownership the car broke down, towed(Saturday) to Vermogen which my friend paid for their so called warranty, typically borne by the dealer, Vermogen is supposed to cover gearbox and engine for 3 years.



Monday Vermogen got back, Vivian, with a bill, simply put, Mechatronics, Clutch and Flywheel, approx 4.7k bill, I told my friend based on the description the likely culprit would be the gearbox, fairly common for V brand, asked her to tow to a 3rd party/own workshop for second opinion, knowing typically these warranty workshops will start to push blame, cite wear and tear, not transparent with diagnosis etc.



Was told by Vermogen if we tow the car away, warranty will be void, that is fine if their diagnosis is correct, since non gearbox and engine issue is not claimable anyway.



Tow to own workshop, there were some fault codes associated with gearbox problem(I am not super technical please don't quote me), strip the gearbox and it was in a very bad condition, but the mechatronics was fine, clutch and flywheel has to go, there were alot of wear & tear issues to which was fine.



Called Gears & Gasoline sales, ZY, told us not his problem, contact the warranty workshop, he was rude and frankly, not very helpful.



The used car was pretty expensive considered what it was, it's fine, willing buyer willing seller, but they billed another $400(Warranty) and some Thermostat($600) replacement, also with Vermogen.



With the Gearbox being faulty(within their warranty) and benefit of doubt that we tow to another workshop, we requested that either Gears & Gasoline or Vermogen foot at least half of the cost of a used gearbox, then we move on from there no obligation to each other.



Vermogen is definitely free to write and terms and conditions but consumers should be entitled to a second opinion from a mutual, non-associated workshop for a second opinion, otherwise, might as well write them a blank cheque.



So our call with Vermogen, Vivian, we asked a few questions pertaining to the gearbox, firstly she said they did not strip the gearbox, not sure how they check the gearbox if they do not strip it, since based on fault code, the gear is stuck in reverse.



We tried to remediate with both parties, Vivian from Vermogen went MIA, then halfway through our conversation she hanged up on us.



ZY brought us around the park basically and offered no solution whatsoever.



Be WARNED everyone!



We are happy to be interviewed by influencers, youtubers, news media etc since the workshop commented they will sue for defamation, happy to take up the challenge because we believe in the Singapore justice system and that we are absolutely, without a benefit of doubt, the victim here.



Intention of us sharing you ask? I think it's a principle thing and that we just want to share malpractice like these, fairly common actually, I think most car owners in Singapore's can back us up, because like us, they've had to navigate all these car ownership situations.



Not that our post can change anything but, hopefully our small voices can be heard, Singapore being the most expensive city to buy a car, I understand its challenging for the industry, insurance overclaim to cite an example, in 2022 and moving forward, something should change, we are a business hub and highly respected in the region, why are we still so backwards in regards to car ownership?



So pretty please, trolls, take it as ranting whatever, but right is right and wrong is wrong, please be kind don't flame us lah! Flame these unethical business!",14-10-22

thing is they strong-armed consumer into sales and paying for said warranty, the leanest possible which was engine and gb, the specific ride, usually the mechatronics go first for this V brand car.



upon paying said $400 warranty the owner wanted to pursue getting it back because said warranty workshop did 0 repair, even the tow was absorb by the owner.



the item that they did not honour the warranty was the gearbox, the fault codes were a big sign so the 3rd party workshop we went to strip it, horrendous condition no wonder the grinding sounds, it was stuck in reverse gear btw.



sourced a used gearbox, we just wanted Vermogen to absorb in part, $400, what owner paid for warranty, that is not unreasonable. not only did they say no, they were evasive, even cited defamation suite when we say we will share our experience online in full transparency, you not triggered meh.

Monday Vermogen got back, Vivian, with a bill, simply put, Mechatronics, Clutch and Flywheel, approx 4.7k bill, I told my friend based on the description the likely culprit would be the gearbox, fairly common for V brand, asked her to tow to a 3rd party/own workshop for second opinion, knowing typically these warranty workshops will start to push blame, cite wear and tear, not transparent with diagnosis etc.



Was told by Vermogen if we tow the car away, warranty will be void, that is fine if their diagnosis is correct, since non gearbox and engine issue is not claimable anyway.



Tow to own workshop, there were some fault codes associated with gearbox problem(I am not super technical please don't quote me), strip the gearbox and it was in a very bad condition, but the mechatronics was fine, clutch and flywheel has to go, there were alot of wear & tear issues to which was fine.

Nightmare happened to a friend, tried to remediate on her behalf and was met with unprofessionalism and absolute rudeness, one would think a customer would get basic courtesy of sorts, I understand some may point out that my friend should have done her due diligence, but her being a first time buyer, the process can be a little intimidating even with homework of sorts done.

Called Gears & Gasoline sales, ZY, told us not his problem, contact the warranty workshop, he was rude and frankly, not very helpful.



The used car was pretty expensive considered what it was, it's fine, willing buyer willing seller, but they billed another $400(Warranty) and some Thermostat($600) replacement, also with Vermogen.

Must really be frustrating to be in this situation. Owning a car should be a happy thing - enjoying the convenience and the rides but this had had to happen. Guess this is an expensive lesson learnt. Luckily the car cause an accident on the road and nobody was hurt. Next time better send for STA/AA evaluation before buying second hand car. Might not be fool proof, but as newbies who don't know anything about cars, it's an added layer of protection.



Personally after test driving so many second hand cars all over the island, my impression's that Carros Centre aka Jalan Lam Huat dealers have the shadiest dealers. Haha told my partner we're never going back there again.",

Over 3k, mechatronics no issue which the warranty workshop tried to bill her.

"1. Not encouraged to buy these ""extended warranty"" package horseshit. No profitable business in the right mind will honor (all warranty) on a used car transmission for 3yrs for a sum of less than $1000. Makes no business sense.



2. Know that although warranty is supposed to cover transmission & engine, but warranty clauses will have this clause that basically makes whatever they warranty against invalid.

It will state that it does not cover wear and tear. What the hell is not wear and tear on a car? even the exhaust pipe hanger or wiper blade, heck even windscreen permanent smudge is wear and tear ok.

Impossible? wait until you hear how creative they can be to cook up a reason on wear and tear.

Wheel nut la. maybe that one not wear and tear.



3. If you manage to claim under warranty, good for you. Its really up to the dealer's workshop to honor the claims. But know that you are on the losing side when it comes to any dispute.



In summary, need to check carefully before buying. After buy, expect that any repairs will be borne by owner.

Try to claim, but don't expect any good to come out of it. if can claim good, bonus. Say thank you and move on.

Will be happier if the expectations are set right.",19-10-22

Salesperson ZY was pushy, intentionally withheld information, e.g condition of car, non-LTA approved components that will fail inspection, also he did not explained the difference between consignment or dealer unit and that lemon law is not applicable for consignment units.



3 weeks into the ownership the car broke down, towed(Saturday) to Vermogen which my friend paid for their so called warranty, typically borne by the dealer, Vermogen is supposed to cover gearbox and engine for 3 years.



Monday Vermogen got back, Vivian, with a bill, simply put, Mechatronics, Clutch and Flywheel, approx 4.7k bill, I told my friend based on the description the likely culprit would be the gearbox, fairly common for V brand, asked her to tow to a 3rd party/own workshop for second opinion, knowing typically these warranty workshops will start to push blame, cite wear and tear, not transparent with diagnosis etc.



Was told by Vermogen if we tow the car away, warranty will be void, that is fine if their diagnosis is correct, since non gearbox and engine issue is not claimable anyway.



Tow to own workshop, there were some fault codes associated with gearbox problem(I am not super technical please don't quote me), strip the gearbox and it was in a very bad condition, but the mechatronics was fine, clutch and flywheel has to go, there were alot of wear & tear issues to which was fine.



Called Gears & Gasoline sales, ZY, told us not his problem, contact the warranty workshop, he was rude and frankly, not very helpful.



The used car was pretty expensive considered what it was, it's fine, willing buyer willing seller, but they billed another $400(Warranty) and some Thermostat($600) replacement, also with Vermogen.



With the Gearbox being faulty(within their warranty) and benefit of doubt that we tow to another workshop, we requested that either Gears & Gasoline or Vermogen foot at least half of the cost of a used gearbox, then we move on from there no obligation to each other.



Vermogen is definitely free to write and terms and conditions but consumers should be entitled to a second opinion from a mutual, non-associated workshop for a second opinion, otherwise, might as well write them a blank cheque.



So our call with Vermogen, Vivian, we asked a few questions pertaining to the gearbox, firstly she said they did not strip the gearbox, not sure how they check the gearbox if they do not strip it, since based on fault code, the gear is stuck in reverse.



We tried to remediate with both parties, Vivian from Vermogen went MIA, then halfway through our conversation she hanged up on us.



ZY brought us around the park basically and offered no solution whatsoever.



Be WARNED everyone!



We are happy to be interviewed by influencers, youtubers, news media etc since the workshop commented they will sue for defamation, happy to take up the challenge because we believe in the Singapore justice system and that we are absolutely, without a benefit of doubt, the victim here.



Intention of us sharing you ask? I think it's a principle thing and that we just want to share malpractice like these, fairly common actually, I think most car owners in Singapore's can back us up, because like us, they've had to navigate all these car ownership situations.



Not that our post can change anything but, hopefully our small voices can be heard, Singapore being the most expensive city to buy a car, I understand its challenging for the industry, insurance overclaim to cite an example, in 2022 and moving forward, something should change, we are a business hub and highly respected in the region, why are we still so backwards in regards to car ownership?



So pretty please, trolls, take it as ranting whatever, but right is right and wrong is wrong, please be kind don't flame us lah! Flame these unethical business!

This really sucks and I know how it feels as I have also experienced some issues with the recent 2nd hand car that I recently purchased. My total expense so far have already exceeded 1,000 + from my own pocket and the dealer still has an audacity to ask me to leave a good review in their Facebook page!   



Issues within 3 months of owning it:



1. Side mirror signal light not working. I argued with dealer , he was initially saying that it was wear and tear! he eventually agreed that it will be FOC to fix it.



2. I had issues whereby whenever I brake, it slightly shifts to the left -- went back to dealer's authorized dealer in Carros and they initially told me that it was a bushing / long arm issue so I left my car there. When I came back, I was been told that it eventually it wasn't the bushing but just the brake calipers. They replaced it and I was charged $110, I happily left the shop thinking the issue has been fixed but NO, issue still persist! So I argued back with the dealer and they agreed to replace the lower arm for $300! Finally issue has been fixed!



3. Tyre puncture and all thread gone. So I got towed in ECP ! I was so lucky because the tow guys told me that I can get fined by LTA for ""negligence"" since it is literally ZERO thread left on both front tires. The dealer told me that this is not their fault again saying that it is a normal wear and tear. I was soo furious and decided not to engage any repairs from them. I replaced both front tires for $240! Tow truck expense to car mechanic, $50. 



4. Mounting issue. The car vibrates so much whenever it is on ""D"" mode so it is very annoying. I forked out my own expense for $385 to replace 4 mountings.



5. Only the driver side power windows are working, crap. LOL! Luckily, this is a FOC repair with the the new mechanic  I engaged with.



6. Car was very very dirty inside when I drove it outside the garage. It just looks ""new"" externally. My fault for not really looking at it.



7. Car's rims are badly scratched and damaged, I also did not see it as Carros' area is really dark. I paid $240 to have it sprayed. 



8. Check Engine Light on for Catalytic Converter. The mechanic told me to buy a Cat-Cleaner which I did ($90) but it didn't solve the CEL.  Anyway, I just left it as it as and I removed the error from my ODB scanner.I just passed my car inspection anyway so I guess it is OK.

I told this to the dealer and was told that they can just clean it but I doubt it that it will solve the issue as it may need a replacement. 



Total expense so far:  $1,415

TBH, I will consider these to be fair wear & tear. The buyer can go fix.



134567



1. signal a few dollars only. anytime a bulb can be blown, how to know which is spoilt? and even if you know, you never check, spend a few dollars at most workshop to fix.



3. poor tyres is a norm for most used cars. for safety, I always go change to new tyres immediately when I have the chance.



4. engine mounting is wear & tear. you should feel the vibration during test drive. but it's only a few hundred dollars thingy. some buyers I know will go change this to get that new car feel without vibration.



5. never test before buying? if yes, ask them to fix before handing over.



7. just clean up lor. Carro buy their car as it is (After check) and sell as it is usually also. rarely go clean up since they have so many cars and limited manpower.



for 2, I think you mean change brake pad for $110? calliper for $110 is super cheap. glad that change arm can fix



to be very fair, you cannot expect a 100% used car unless it's less than 3 years old, decent mileage and under warranty and servicing package. sure have things that you need to replace. put aside additional 2k for asian made, 7k for Conti is norm. 



some used cars really don't need to spend so much, then that's lucky lor.",

Item 3 & 7.

Is no excuse and you the buyer to blame on.  Seem like you buying some items from the neighborhood low value shop. Take and go.

Anyway, the tuition fee paid and lessons learnt will always with you.  Make sure you checked in details or goes with a few of your frds for your next car shopping trip.



In reality, why should a salesman who he/she do not know you tells you all the bad points of this car leh? Tell you oredi, will you still buy it? 

They can tell you this phrase, ""Dun worry, is covered under warranty for the GB and Engine. Anything wrong, comes back to them, they have deliciated workshops. Professional.""



Good luck!",

You see lor, the 6 will be praised to the skies, suddenly the Maz3 a lot of issues appear.   this is called sales.",

What you cannot see, you cannot know and no way of knowing. It also doesn't change the fact it's a 2nd hand car and the inspection is done by a human. Anything human done will have over lapse, even if there are SOPs in place. 



It's good enough for a general piece of mind, but it won't prevent everything.",

			This really sucks and I know how it feels as I have also experienced some issues with the recent 2nd hand car that I recently purchased. My total expense so far have already exceeded 1,000 + from my own pocket and the dealer still has an audacity to ask me to leave a good review in their Facebook page!  



Issues within 3 months of owning it:



1. Side mirror signal light not working. I argued with dealer , he was initially saying that it was wear and tear! he eventually agreed that it will be FOC to fix it.



2. I had issues whereby whenever I brake, it slightly shifts to the left -- went back to dealer's authorized dealer in Carros and they initially told me that it was a bushing / long arm issue so I left my car there. When I came back, I was been told that it eventually it wasn't the bushing but just the brake calipers. They replaced it and I was charged $110, I happily left the shop thinking the issue has been fixed but NO, issue still persist! So I argued back with the dealer and they agreed to replace the lower arm for $300! Finally issue has been fixed!



3. Tyre puncture and all thread gone. So I got towed in ECP ! I was so lucky because the tow guys told me that I can get fined by LTA for ""negligence"" since it is literally ZERO thread left on both front tires. The dealer told me that this is not their fault again saying that it is a normal wear and tear. I was soo furious and decided not to engage any repairs from them. I replaced both front tires for $240! Tow truck expense to car mechanic, $50.



4. Mounting issue. The car vibrates so much whenever it is on ""D"" mode so it is very annoying. I forked out my own expense for $385 to replace 4 mountings.



5. Only the driver side power windows are working, crap. LOL! Luckily, this is a FOC repair with the the new mechanic  I engaged with.



6. Car was very very dirty inside when I drove it outside the garage. It just looks ""new"" externally. My fault for not really looking at it.



7. Car's rims are badly scratched and damaged, I also did not see it as Carros' area is really dark. I paid $240 to have it sprayed.



8. Check Engine Light on for Catalytic Converter. The mechanic told me to buy a Cat-Cleaner which I did ($90) but it didn't solve the CEL.  Anyway, I just left it as it as and I removed the error from my ODB scanner.I just passed my car inspection anyway so I guess it is OK.

I told this to the dealer and was told that they can just clean it but I doubt it that it will solve the issue as it may need a replacement.



Total expense so far:  $1,415



There are still some minor issues that still bothers me but they are negligible but I wished the dealer could have been more honest with the issues before selling it.

Thats on that day checks and that day reports. All independent inspection center only follows a list of check points. For peace of mind. Personally, that's all a buyer can do for getting a pre-own ride.

Which light bulb first? Cabin lights, boot lights, rear lights, fog lights or headlights/pole light? You can always refer to your owner's manual.



For headlights (assuming yours is halogen, not factory LED), it's super easy to change for most cars, just twist either CW or ACW, pull out, unplug the socket behind (press and hold), plug in new bulb to the socket harness, put in new one to twist lock, kao tim.



Unless your headlight bulb is blocked or difficult to access, changing headlight bulb is super easy. Just open your bonnet and try to look for the bulb holder wiring harness and socket behind. There should be sufficient space behind. For moi previous Toyota, the space behind can put in a chicken, LOL. so there is zero reason you can't access and change the light bulb (my current Toyota ride only high beam can change, but headlight low beam is factory LED, so can't change also as stated in the owner's manual unless goto AD or modified, LOL).



 If you go workshop to just change a headlight, I think the mechanic jitao shake head, LOL.



For fog lights, ah..then it's more difficult as you need to remove the lower plastic panels to access and turn the steering to one side, quite dirty job, then need to secure the harness (if you are changing to LED kind due to longer cables). Same for rear lights or license plate lights, as you need to remove panels which if you don't have the technique (some need to depress the centre 'button' like for moi Toyota), might break the plastic fasteners which need replacement (quite cheap only)



For cabin lights, it's normally T10, but it's removing the light cover that is little tricky. you can go youtube and just search for your car model, mostly should be able to find how to remove the light cover. Once the cover is removed, changing the T10 bulb is easy peasy like lemon squeezy.",

Actually everything can DIY, mechanics also learn who to do repair what. They can learn, you can also learn.



But if no time to learn and want to prevent mistake affecting the car, then opportunity cost is to pay for workshop to replace.",

		Click to expand...
	


Then better go workshop. Rear signal light is a little tricky due to access issue. For my current ride, I can't even find the rear turn signal light replacement SOP inside my owner's manual. Means it's for workshop to replace already.



Problem with rear signal light is it's a slot in type e.g. T20 or 7440, just like light the cabin light T10, after you remove the socket. Cabin or boot light no issue, because if the T10 drop out, you can retrieve and push it back.



So it's not only the clips but if not careful if not pushed in deep enough on the socket, you might end up dropping the light bulb in the housing which happened to moi previous ride before. Not sure what the mech did, he push here and there, end up drop inside housing, siao and he needs to use a magnetic picker to retrieve the light bulb, LOL.",

But lightbulb need to go shop?



if shop online for delivery, and have tools to open light cover, can always DIY



at most if anything spoil or cannot out back etx then go workshop?



if own the car, and bought it new, why take risks?



SG everything expensive,

Anything appil

And need replacement eg car parts, not so easy to buy parts and replace 



unlike overseas,  it difficult to find parts for older cars, most people have tools too, everything not so expensive due to hyper markets everywhere eg costco, target etx 

anything also have sales, and affordable",
DIY is good. can learn things. nvr know when you will need the skill next time,
"Market is pushed by demand and supply



as more people buy online



workshops have little reason to remain open



their earning are decreased - little incentive to operate



end up only big players can remain open ie authorized  dealers - they then become monopolies and push prices of car ownership higher



which seems to be ok for locals



since people pay so much for COE abs car ownership

But choose to save on car maintenance



which explains why most cars don’t go beyond 5-years ownership - that’s when most car parts need replacement



as people trade-in 5-years old car for brand new cars, authorized dealers will indent from car manufacturers and factories will soon use parts that are good for about 5 years since customers upgrade



which in the end,

Decrease quality of cars

increase prices of car ownerships",

So this fella earned 20k out of a $100 battery change probably. But reputation sure take a hit irregardless whether this fella win or not. Why?



Because this case proved one fact, they sold a faulty battery and poor workmanship also. Their T&C also is on the grey area. Battery one year warranty, So right after they installed they should provide services to check the battery and not charge anything even if it's not the battery's fault.



Anyway the car owner confirm learnt lesson the hard way. what to change battery just go proper workshop. DOn't engage these mobile repair vans. Got problem complain will tio sue.",

The judge noted the workshop had told Mr Tang that it would charge him only if his car's issues were unrelated to the battery it had installed, to which he replied, ""okay lah, fair enough lah"".

So this fella earned 20k out of a $100 battery change probably. But reputation sure take a hit irregardless whether this fella win or not. Why?



Because this case proved one fact, they sold a faulty battery and poor workmanship also. Their T&C also is on the grey area. Battery one year warranty, So right after they installed they should provide services to check the battery and not charge anything even if it's not the battery's fault.



Anyway the car owner confirm learnt lesson the hard way. what to change battery just go proper workshop. DOn't engage these mobile repair vans. Got problem complain will tio sue.

			15?The appellant highlighted that, upon the respondent contacting the appellant, the appellant offered to attend to the respondent on-site regarding the car issues, and that the appellant would charge a service fee only if the issues detected in the respondent’s vehicle were not attributed to the car battery installed by the appellant. This was evidenced in:

(a)?the Audio Transcription by JC Translation Pte Ltd of the WhatsApp voice conversation between the appellant’s manager, Mr Tay Leong Beng (“Mr Tay”) and the respondent (“JC Translation”). In this conversation, the appellant clearly indicated that he would only charge the respondent an on-site fee if it transpired that the issue was not related to the battery:                  



Mr Tay:?[p]layer no power ... is sometimes due to other components or other thing ah, short circuit and short until the player, but I can come down drop by to see your car ... if it’s not related to my battery, then I’ll have an on-site fee…

...

Mr Tay:?… if it’s related to the battery, then definitely I’ll be responsible ... but normally ... battery ... don’t link to your player this kind of thing ... but it’s ok ... I mean if you want me come down and check I’m ok to come down…

...

Mr Tay:?… the way I say is I can come down to check no problem, but anything is not related to my battery, then it’s chargeable... to be fair.

Moral of story is- Ah Beng always pwns average joes in life



If the ah beng workshop rely over-charge u & ur reviews/complains are legit, they just close shop & operate another new one using a diff name. U LL suck thumb



If they never over-charge u and u complain, they will sue u until ur pants drop. U also LL suck thumb.



End of day, they will always win cos they are rich & savvy. 



Personal experience is I will never patronize any of these ah beng shops- be it for my cars or iPhones.



Car got issues, just go back to AD. iPhones got probs, just bring back to Apple. Might cost slightly more, but at least I have a peace of mind. Get good service, dun have to worry about being cheated or having to deal with all these ah bengs.



And in the case of any disputes, they will always resolve it properly once u feedback to the management. No such thing as they sue or threaten customers etc",

About 10 days later, he found several issues with the audio system and roof lights of his car, and asked the workshop to check the battery.

Oh ok fair enough...



But if the customer already suspected the workshop never did a good job... why still let them check? They could have secretly fixed the battery and loose wiring and tell the customer the problem is not related to the battery... of coz is find a 3rd party workshop or mechanic to diagnose the problem... i think this is fair to both side... 



I understand the sentiment from both sides... one is dun trust the workshop why let them check further... the other is the customer never give chance for them to remedy the problem...



The ruling is a bit harsh on the customer i feel... he omitted the ""IF"" part... and that costs him so much... but fact is he got a faulty battery that lead to his other equipment having problem... The workshop might have won the case... but i think they lose more customers with this case out in the public... 



IF it is u... will u let them check again?



This is a lesson for everyone also... want to rant online... make sure it is the TRUTH... or even HALF TRUTH... but never LIE... He might not have deliberately want to omit certain facts... but should be clearer on the whole account of the incident... To reach the court... they probably went through a few rounds of mediation liao... he and the workshop got lots of chances to settle this out of court... to prevent further costs and lost of reputation to both parties... in my opinion both parties LOST...",

-ve review and libel and defamation is a very thin line.



According to the report, they asked him to retract, that was to give him a way out, he refused, so the onus was on him.",

Good question. Workshop already said if battery really got problem, no charges will apply. If his car sound system really got issue, that's a separate issue altogether.



I think he panicked or some sort when he heard the words ""charges"", cos if really not battery problem, he has to fork out more money + xia suay his sound system lousy etc",

very simple

the workshop owes it to the customer to do a check, n this check is free of charge regardless whether the check detect problems with battery or due to other issues.

the workshop cannot say if it is due to other issues u will be charged just for the checking.. so this is not right.

 

i think this kind of workshop must avoid.",

Yes, climate change is fake.



You can't change climate, you can however; slow it down. Carbon footprint is all over, you can only reduce that much to generate more. It's a vicious cycle. How do you change climate without eradicating the earth of humans? Humans are the ones causing it, and now they want to reverse it with increasing population, power hungry buildings & automotives as well as never ending growing data centers that need more and more power including quantum processing that they actually sell you the idea of 'green energy'?



Green energy is still energy, carbon footprints arises regardless how we define or wikipedia or google defines it. It doesn't void the fact that our actions are just killing earth slowly but surely. So, isn't green energy, climate change (for the better) and compensation overrated?



You cause something then take steps to offset it. It's like committing a crime then go to jail to offset it. How does that even justify the crime?",31-07-22

That doesn't void the fact there is carbon footprint still. Maintenance is always on-going, that's carbon footprint too.

I went to google what’s the definition of carbon footprint “A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.”



if want to be pedantic, then yes, you will definitely incur it. But that’s why you take steps to offset it.



I’m not sure what’s overrated about compensating for it.



but anyway are you suggesting that climate change is fake?",

Yes, climate change is fake.



You can't change climate, you can however; slow it down. Carbon footprint is all over, you can only reduce that much to generate more. It's a vicious cycle. How do you change climate without eradicating the earth of humans? Humans are the ones causing it, and now they want to reverse it with increasing population, power hungry buildings & automotives as well as never ending growing data centers that need more and more power including quantum processing that they actually sell you the idea of 'green energy'?



Green energy is still energy, carbon footprints arises regardless how we define or wikipedia or google defines it. It doesn't void the fact that our actions are just killing earth slowly but surely. So, isn't green energy, climate change (for the better) and compensation overrated?



You cause something then take steps to offset it. It's like committing a crime then go to jail to offset it. How does that even justify the crime?",

No way to net 0 carbon... unless humans die. What we're doing is delaying the inevitable before earth becomes inhabitable. That's all, we are not reversing the damage done over the past 200 years.",

Even if u die also got carbon generated.



point is - we are all gonna die come 2B years later when the Hydrogen store in our sun exhausts and switches to burning Helium.",

			Whenever owners bring their own purchased parts in and want the mechanic to fix up.



Mark up is at least 2 times.



No wonder some workshop owners, repair cars until can buy landed or drive Maserati.

you can easily move to another workshop and ask them about the labour rate.. the thing is, is it worth your time searching for it or not?



don't just say car repair. Just look at plumber, would you want an experienced reputable plumber to sort out your problem within 1hr that labour cost is more or an unknown plumber that you found on carousell that is cheaper than the experienced plumber by 2 time?



workshop that have good reputation doesn't achieve overnight. Just take a look at SKM, many people seek Ah Heng for help for Honda problem, and how many people bring their cars to service and willing to wait as long as few hrs to get attended?



conclusion, u so kiang, u replace urself lor. save your labour fee.",
